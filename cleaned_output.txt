Executive Summary  i ELECTION ADMINISTRATION AND VOTING SURVEY 2020 COMPREHENSIVE REPORT A REPORT FROM THE U.S. ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION TO THE 117TH CONGRESS ii  Executive Summary Executive Summary  i Executive Summary Since 2004, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission EAC has conducted the Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS following each federal general election. The EAVS asks all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to provide data about the ways Americans vote and how elections are administered. Since 2008, this project has included a separate survey, the Election Administration Policy Survey Policy Survey , that collects information about state election laws, p olicies, and practices. The EAVS provides the most comprehensive source of state and local jurisdiction lev el data about election administration in the United States. Thes e data play a vital role in helping election officials, policymakers, and other elect ion stakeholders identify trends, anticipate and respond to changing voter needs , invest resources to improve election administration and the voter experience, and better secure U.S. elections infrastructure. The EAVS data make it possible to examine the details of the U.S. election infrastructure and to produce a generalizable understanding of core aspects of the election process and the management challenges faced by election officials. The survey provides policymakers and the public with critical information every two years about how federal elections are conducted , and it helps the EAC fulfill its congressionally mandated reporting requirements. The EAVS is also invaluable to election officials who use the data to manage election oversight, conduct issue analysis and strategic planning, and create training and promotional materials. The EAC also uses EAVS data to create clearinghouse resources to advance the agencys mission and to better support election officia ls and voters as well as to inform lawmakers and national level stakeholders about the impact of federal voting laws and the changing landscape of U.S. elections. The 2 020 g eneral election was heavily affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. The pandemic and the ensuing public health emergency necessitated a variety of changes to existing election practices to accommodate social distancing and to slow the spread of the virus among voters, poll workers, and election officials and staff. In response, many states to ok action to expand the availability of in  person voting before Election Day and mail voting. Because of its status as the most comprehensive survey of election administration in the United States, the 2020 EAVS serves as a record of the extraordinary effo rts by the nations election officials and poll workers to ensure that the 2020 general election was conducted in a safe and secure manner. To this end, the EAC is pleased to present to the 117 th Congress its report on the 2020 EAVS. This report describes in detail how the 2020 federal general election was administered and how voters cast their ballots. Data from the EAVS and the accompanying Election Administration Policy Survey Policy Survey are used to provide an overview of each of the following aspec ts of the election process  Turnout, voting methods, polling places, poll workers, and election technology are covered in Chapter 1, Overview of Election Administration and Voting in the 2020 General Election ii  Executive Summary  Key laws, rules, polic ies, and procedures that govern U.S. elections are covered in Chapter 2, Election Law and Procedure The Policy Survey   Voter registration and list maintenance are covered in Chapter 3,  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond   Voting by individuals cov ered under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act UOCAVA is described in Chapter 4, Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 UOCAVA  and  Finally, the methodology of the EAVS and a description of the survey questions are discussed in Chapt er 5,  Survey Methodology and Procedures . Voting and Election Administration Findings The 2020 EAVS confirms that the 2020 general election saw the highest turnout of any federal general election recorded by the EAVS to date, with 67.7 of the citizen voting age population CVAP casting ballots that were counted , an increase of 6.7 percentage points from 2016 levels. Nearly every sta te saw an increase in turnout compared to the 2016 EAVS. Furthermore, more than 209 million people were active registered voters for the 2020 g eneral election, which represents an all  time high, and more than 161 million voters cast ballots that were counted for this election. This election also saw sweeping changes in how voters cast their ballots. In the 2016 EAVS , 54.5 of voters cast their ballots in person on Election Day , and in the 2018 EAVS, 58.2 of voters did so . In 2020, only 30.5  of voters cast their ballots in person on Election Day . The percentage of the electorate that voted a mailed ballot increased to 43.1  of the electorate, nearly a 20percentage  point increase from 2016 levels. Jurisdiction level analysis shows that the largest increases in mail voting rates occurred in jurisdictions in states that newly instituted all mail elections in 2020 and in jurisdictions in states that removed requirements to provide an excuse to request a mailed ballot. Although the total number of mail ed ballots transmitted in 2020 was more than double the number transmitted in 2016, the percentages of mail ed ballots that were returned by voters, that were counted, and that were rejected did not change significantly at the national level. States reported a total of 132,556 polling places at which 775,101 poll workers assisted voters with inperson early and Election Day voting. The data also show a shift in the age distribution of poll workers, with the percentage of poll workers ages 18 to 25 and 26 to 40 increasing to 6.2 and 15.0, respectively, and the percentage of poll workers ages 61 to 70 and 71 and older decreasing , to 27.3 and 20.1, respectively . Jurisdictions also reported that poll worker recruitment was less difficult in 2020 than it was in 2016. In survey comments, many jurisdictions cited cross cuttin g effects on their recruitment efforts. Jurisdictions reported that the COVID 19 pandemic made it difficult to retain long time, older poll workers and caused last minute poll worker shortages, but the efforts of the EAC, state election offices, and other organizations to encourage qualified individuals to serve as poll workers were cited as helping contribute to an oversupply of poll workers in some areas. States reported that the use of electronic poll books or e poll books increased since the 2018 EAVS, and 17 states used e poll books in all of their jurisdictions. Scanners and ballot marking devices BMD continued to be the most common types of voting equipment used , and the use of Executive Summary  iii direct recording electronic DRE machines that were not equipped with a voter verified paper audit trail DRE without VVPAT also continued to decline . In 2020, o nly 32 jurisdictions across the country relied solely on voting machines with no paper backup. Election Administration Policy Survey Findings To provide context to the data that states report in the EAVS, the EAC collects information about states election policies. Two thirds of states reported having top down registration systems hosted on a single, central platform or mainframe that is maintained by the state with information supplied by local jurisdictions the remaining one third of states reported having bottom up or hybrid databases. To keep their voter registration rolls accurate and up to date, most states reported sharing information with motor vehicle agencies, government entities that maintain death records, and agencies that maintain felony or prison records . The percentage of states offering both same day registration 51.8  and online registration 80.4  increased since the 2018 Polic y Survey. The Policy Survey also recorded an increase in state policies that make it safer for voters to cast a ballot or to reduce potential lines and crowds at in person polling places. In 2020, a total of 1 4 states reported having all mail elections, in which all registered voters or all active registered voters were automatically sent a mail ed ballot10 of these states conducted allmail elections statewide, whereas four of the states did so only in select jurisdictions. This was an increase from the 2018 Policy Survey, which found that three states administered their elections entirely by mail and four states had all mail elections in select local jurisdictions. In addition, 69.6 of stat es did not require voters to provide an excuse to be able to vote a mailed ballot seven states had removed the excuse requirement since the 2018 Policy Survey , and 51.8 of states reported that there were some circumstances under which voters could recei ve ballots electronically. However, the Policy Survey did not collect information on whether policy changes made for the 2020 general election were permanent or temporary, or whether the changes were made in direct response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Nearly all states reported that voting systems must be tested and certified before approval, with the most common certification requirements being testing by an EAC accredited voting system test laboratory VSTL, certification according to the EAC adopted Volun tary Voting System Guidelines VVSG, and both state and federal certification . In 2020, of the 40 states that reported using epoll books, 55 required testing and certification to the states specifications before purchasing the epoll books. In the post election period, 78.6 of states reported that they required a tabulation audit to verify the voting equipment used to count ballots worked properly. Of these states, about three quarters required a traditional tabulation audit which examines a sample of ballots from a fixed percentage of randomly selected voting districts or voting machines , whereas about onefifth of the states required a risk limiting tabulation audit in which statistical methods are used to select the audit sample size. All states reported having a mechanism for conducting election recounts, although the circumstances under which a recount would be conducted varie d by state. iv  Executive Summary The National Voter Registration Act NVRA Findings The 2020 EAVS data show the active voter registration rate for the 2020 g eneral election was 88.2 of the CVAP , which represents an increase of 3.5 percentage points since the 2016 EAVS. More than 103 million voter registration applications were submitted between the close of registration for the 2018 general election and the close of registration for the 2020 g eneral election, which represents a 33.8 increase in the number of registration applications received in the period leading up to t he 2016 general election. Of the registration applications received, the most common outcome was an update to the voters existing registration record that did not involve a cross jurisdiction change of address . This type of update accounted for nearly hal f of the registration applications received. New and valid registrations that resulted in the creation of a new voter registration record within the jurisdiction accounted for nearly one third of the applications received. As with previous iterations of the EAVS, state motor vehicle departments accounted for the largest share of these registration applications  39.3 . The second most common source of these applications was online registration, which accounted for 28.2  of applications. Online registration also saw the fastest growth of any registration source tracked by the EAVS. The 29 states and territories that allow same day voter registration SDR reported receiving more than 1.6 million SDRs during the voting period for the 2020 general election, approximately double the number received during the 2018 EAVS. SDR allows individuals to register to vote on the same day that they cast their ballot for an election. Nationwide, more SDRs were received on Election Day than were received during early voting. Pursuant to the NVRA requirements, states reported sending more than 28 million confirmation notices and removing more than 18 million voter registration records from their voter registration rolls between the close of registration for the 2018 g eneral election and the close of registration for the 2020 g eneral election. The most common reasons cited for removing voter registration records were failure to respond to a confirmation notice and to vote in the two most recent federal general elections, moving from the jurisdiction in which the voter was registered to vote, and the voters death. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act UOCAVA Findings States reported transmitting more than 1.2 million ballots to UOCAVA voters a population that includes members of the uniformed services absent from their voting residence, their eligible family members, and U.S. citizens living overseas who receive special protections under the federal UOCAVA law. Of those transmitted ballots, more than 900,000 were returned by voters and nearly 890,000 were counted in the election. Continuing a trend that began with the 2016 EAVS, in 2020, overseas citizens made up a larger proportion of the UOCAVA population than did uniformed services members and their eligible family members. In 2020, o verseas citizens accounted for 57.4 of registered UOCAVA voters , and Executive Summary  v uniformed services members accounted for 42.3. Three states California, Florida, and Washington accounted for slightly more than 40 of all the registered UOCAVA voters reported nationwide. Among uniformed services voters, postal mail transmission was the most common method reported accounting for nearly half of the ballots transmitted to uniformed services voters, whereas overseas citizens more commonly received their ballots through email accounting for 70.9 of ballots transmitted to overseas citizens. Nearly 98 of UOCAVA ballots returned by voters were reported as counted, with just over 2 of returned ballots reported as rejected. Nationwide, more than 33,000 Federal Write In Absentee Ballots FWAB were reported as received . This form may be submitted by UOC AVA voters as an emergency backup ballot in case their official ballot is not received by local election officials in time to be counted. The FWAB allowed nearly 24,000 UOCAVA voters to have their votes counted in the 2020 general election. vi  T his report by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission is the result of a contract to collect and analyze data for the 20 20 Election Administration and Voting Survey.

Overview of Election Administration and Voting in the 2020 General Election Key Findings The 2020 Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS collected data on ballots cast, voter registration, overseas and military voting, voting technology, and other important issues related to voting and election administration. The 2020 g eneral election was especially impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic, which caused drastic changes to how the election was administered and how voters cast their ballots. Notable findings from the 2020 EAVS include  More than 209 million people were active registered voters for the 2020 g eneral election, an alltime high for the EAVS.  Voter turnout for the 2020 g eneral election reached the highest level documented in any EAVS thus far, at 67.7 of the citizen voting age population CVAP . Turnout increased 6.7 percentage points from 2016 levels, and nearly all states reported an increase in turnout. More than 161 million voters cast ballots that were counted for the 2020 election.  For the first time, a majority of voters cast their ballots before Election Day . Slightly more than 43 of voters participated with a mail ed ballot, and 30.6 of ballots were cast through in  person voting before Election Day . Ballots cast on Election Day at a physical polling place comprised 30.5  of the turnout for the 2020 general election.  The number of mail ed ballots transmitted to voters more than doubled from 2016 to 2020, and the percentage of mailed ballots that were returned by voters, that were counted, and that were rejected held steady with 2016 levels .  The COVID 19 pandemic appears to have been associated with a change in both poll worker recruitment and the resulting age distribution of the poll worker workforce. States reported that the ages of their poll workers skewed younger during the 2020 general election compared to during the 2016 g eneral election. However, states and jurisdictions reported that recruiting poll workers for this election was slightly easier due to national and state efforts that encouraged voters to serve as poll workers.  The most common types of election equipment that were used were paper ballot scanners and ballot marking devices BMD. The use of direct recording electronic machines that were not equipped with a voter verified paper aud it trail DRE without VVPAT continued to decline among jurisdictions since the 2018 general election, and the use of electronic poll books e poll books continued to increase. More than 30 of jurisdictions reported using e poll books an increase of more than 5 percentage points from 2018, and 17 states reported that all jurisdictions used epoll books. Election Administration in the United States The United States is notable for having a largely decentralized system for administering federal elections. Local jurisdictions have the primary responsibility of administering state and federal elections and of tabulating , reporting , and certifying results. T he U.S. Constitution and various federal laws govern specific aspects of federal elections , and a small number of federal agenciessuch as the U.S. Election Assistance Commission EAC and the Federal Voting Assistance Program FVAP  play a supportive role in election administration . Broad legal and procedural authority rests with the states,1 territories, the District of Columbia , and local jurisdictions. As a result, a wide variation exists among and within state election policies and practices, and the policies and practices are constantly evolving. Nevertheless, U.S. elections generally follow a standard process. As shown in Figure 1, the election process can be viewed as a cycle. 1.The legal and procedural framework for elections is generally established in advance of ageneral election. This framework includes determining voter eligibility rules how, when, and where voters may cast their ballots and what technology will be used to support election s. Supported by state election offices, m ost of these policies and procedures are implemented by election officials at the local level e.g., county, township, municipality . 2.To participate in elections, eligible citizens typically must register to vote, pursuant to the eligibility rules established by federal law and by their state. 2 In many states, voters must register in advance of a set registration deadline in others, eligible individuals may registerand cast a ballot on the same day, whether during an early voting period or on El ection Day. Depending on state policy, eligible citizens may have multiple avenues for submitting their registration applications, including by mail, fax, or email online registration websites  in person at an election office, at a motor vehicle office , at other state government agency offices , or at an armed forces recruitment office or through a registration drive. States are also required to periodically examine their voter registration rolls and remove the records of voters who are no longer eligible, for instance , because the voter no longer resides in the state or jurisdiction in which they are registered , the voter has failed to respond to a notice sent to them by mail and has not voted in the two most recent federal general elections , the voter is deceased , or the voter has received a criminal conviction that disqualifies them from voting. The voter may also directly inform the election office of a change in residency, which begins the process of designating a voter as inactive and ultimately removing them from the voter registration roll . The process of updating voter registration rolls and removing ineligible voters is referred to as list maintenance. 3.When a federal general election is approaching, voting begins well in advance of Election Day for many voters, including eligible military voters and overseas citizens who are absent from their voting residence, for whom the right to participate in federal elections is protectedunder the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act UOCAV A. In addition, all 1 Throughout this r eport, u nless otherwise specified, the term state can b e understood to a pply to the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia , and fi ve U.S. t erritories  American Samoa, G uam, t he Northern M arian a Islands, Puerto R ico, and t he U.S. V irgin Isla nds that submi t Election Administration Policy Survey and EAV S data. 2 No rth Dakota is the only state that does not require c itizens to register before casting a ballot in an election. 2  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  3 states provide avenues for voters to cast ballots before Election Day. This may include voting a mailed ballot , casting a ballot in person at a dedicated early voting site, or receiving and casting a ballot at an election office. Some states allow any eligible voter to cast their ballot before Election Day, whereas others restrict early voting and mail voting only to certain segments of the population, such as voters who are absent from their home jurisdiction on Election Day, voters wi th illnesses or disabilities, voters over a certain age, or voters who provide a statutorily valid excuse. The voting options that are available to voters and the timelines for mail voting and in person early voting vary by state and by local jurisdiction. Figure 1. The U.S. Election Process 4. Voters who do not cast ballots beforehand may vote on Election Day at in person voting sites staffed by poll workers. In most states, individuals whose eligibility cannot be verified at the time of voting may cast a provisional ballot. Election officials then investigate the eligibility of individuals who cast provisional ballots to determine whether their ballots should be counted, either in full or in part , or rejected . 5.After the polls close on Election Day, the process of counting ballots to determine th e final election results begin s. This may also be referred to as tabulation or canvassing. State policies vary on when counting may begin some states may begin pre processing mail ed ballots e.g., opening envelopes, verifying the mail voters eligibility to cast a ballot, removing ballots from secrecy envelopes to prepare them for counting before Election Day, whereas other states require that in person polls must be closed before a ny ballots can be counted. Depending on state law and on what equipment is used to process the ballots, ballot counting may take several days to complete. 6.Once the unofficial results of the election are known, state and local election officials review the results for accuracy and certify them as final. After this is complete, many states conduct audits of their election results and voting equipment to ensure that the established electionprocedures were followed and that the equipment functioned correctly. Certain election races may also be recounted if the margin of victory is close  if a candidate , party , or other authorized group requests a recount  or if a court orders a recount to be conducted. The election process can be viewed as a cycle in the sense that the experiences from previous elections are used to inform decision making for the legal and procedural framework for subsequent elections. Often, the successful approaches and innovations implemented in one state or local jurisdiction during an election are adopted by other states or localities in subsequent elections. The COVID 19 pandemic was declared in March 2020 and impacted nearly all aspects of the 2020 voting process, from dates and deadlines to how voters were able to register to vote, option s to cast a ballot , and how long it took to count the ballots. In some cases, certain state policies, such as those concerning mail and absentee voting, were expanded temporarily for the 2020 election cycle to address the COVID 19 restrictions. 3 Throughout the election, state and local election administrators , staff, and poll workers worked heroically to ensure voters were able to exercise their right to vote in a safe and secure manner. The Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS Since 2004, the EAC has conducted the EAVS following each federal general election.4 The EAVS asks all 50 U.S. states , the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories American Samoa, 3 The 2020 Po licy S urvey a nd EAVS di d n ot coll ect information on when a polic y change was made, why it w as m ade, or whet her the change was temporary or permanent. 4 The EA VS d oes not collect da ta on primary e lections, r unoff elections, or special e lections. T h e data provided by states were only for the November 3, 2020, federal general election. 4  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  5 Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Is lands5to provide data about the ways in which Americans vote and how elections are administered. The EAVS provides the most comprehensive source of state and local jurisdiction level data about election administration in the United States. These data pla y a vital role in helping election officials, policymakers, and other election stakeholders identify trends, anticipate and respond to changing voter needs , invest resources to improve election administration and the voter experience, and better secure U.S. elections infrastructure. The EAVS data make it possible to examine the details of the U.S. elections infrastructure and to produce a generalizable understanding of the core aspects of the election process and the management challenges faced by election officials. The survey provides policymakers and the public with critical information every two years about how federal elections are conducted , and it helps the EAC fulfill its congressionally mandated reporting requirements. The EAVS is also invaluable to election officials themselves. These officials use the EAVS to manage election oversight, conduct issue analysis and strategic planning, and create training and promotional materials. The EAC also uses the EAVS data to create research and clearinghouse resources to advance the agencys mission and to better support election officials and voters as well as to inform lawmakers and national level stakeholders about the impact of federal voting laws and the changing landscape of U.S. elections. The EAVS helps the EAC meet its mandate under the Help America Vote Act HAVA to serve as a national clearinghouse and resource for the compilation of information and to review procedures with respect to the administration of federal elections. The EAVS sections related to voter registration and UOCAVA voting allow states to satisfy their data reporting requirements established, respectively, by the National Voter Registration Act NVRA and UOCAVA. The EAVS also helps FVAP fulfill its obligations under UOCAVA to reduce obstacles to ensure military and overseas voting success by collecting data about how UOCAVA voters participate in elections. The EAVS data collection effort consists of two separately administered surveys the Policy Survey and the EAVS. The Policy Survey, which is due in advance of each federal general election, collects data on state election policies and procedures to provide context for the quantitative data included in each states EAVS submission. The EAVS, which is due after each federal general election is complete , collects data on voter registration, UOCAVA voters, mail voting, in person voting and polling operations, provisional ballots, voter participation , and election technology. Complete details about the methodology of the 2020 Policy Survey and t he EAVS, including an outline of the survey questionnaires, the data collection templates, the data validation process, and technical assistance provided to respondents, can be found in Chapter 5,  Survey Methodology and Procedures , of this report. Provi ding EAVS data is frequently a joint task undertaken by state and local jurisdiction election officials. Although 25 states and territories were able to provide all EAVS data from their centralized election database, 31 states and territories r elied on local jurisdictions to provide responses to some 5 Puerto Rico provides EAVS data only in presidential election years, as it does not hold elections for federal candidates in midterm election years. American Samoa did not participate in the 2016 EAVS. The Northern Mariana Isl ands participated in the EAVS for t he first time in 2020. or all of the EAVS questions. An analysis of how states provide EAVS data can be found in Chapter 2 of this report. Chapter 1 of this report covers turnout and modes of voting in the 2020 g enera l election, polling places and poll workers, and election technology. This chapter also comprises a non exhaustive overview of the data provided by states and jurisdictions in the EAVS. State election policies and practices are featured in Chapter 2,  Election Law and Procedure The Policy Survey. Voter registration is covered in greater detail in Chapter 3, Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond. UOCAVA voting is discussed further in Chapter 4,  Military and Overseas Voting in the 2020 General Election UO CAVA . Overall EAVS Response Rates The analysis in this report is based on information and data submitted and certified by the 50 U.S. states, five territories , and the D istrict of Columbia . These 56 entities comprised 6,460 jurisdictions.6 The state level response rate was 100 56 of 56 entities provided data, and the jurisdiction level response rate was 100 6,460 of 6,460 jurisdictions provided data.7 During the data collection period, efforts were made to maximize the completeness and accuracy of the data reported. These efforts are outlined in the methodology of this report Chapter 5. Instances when a states data were not included in a calculation because of missing data or data quality issues are described in the footnotes and table notes that accompany the analysis in this report. Turnout in the 2020 General Election According to the EAVS data submitted by states, there were 228,004,364 voters who were registered to vote in the United States as of November 3, 2020. Of this total, 209,441,338 were considered active voters, which means they had no additional processing requirements to fulfill before voting, and 18,523,963 were considered inactive voters, which means they requir ed address verification under the provisions of the NVRA before they would be permitted to vote. 8 As a percentage of the 2019 CVAP estimate calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau, 88.2 of voting age 6 What constitutes a juri sdiction for EAVS re porting is defi ned by how each s tate chose t o provide da ta. For the 2020 EAVS, most states repor ted data on the county leve l or county equivalent, s uch as p arishes for Lou isiana.

Two j urisdictions in W isconsin w ere consolidated or annexed into other jurisdictions p artway through 2 020. See Ap pendix A in Chapter 5 of this report for a breakdown of the number of jurisdictions reported in each state and the response rate by survey section for each state. 7 Appendix A of C hapter 5 of this report contains an analysis of statelevel response rates to each section of the EAVS. 8 The total num ber of registered voters was collected in item A1a of the EAVS. The total number of a cti ve voters w as collected in item A1b. The total number of inactive voters was collected in i tem A 1c. A ccording t o the 2020 Policy S u rvey, six sta tes Guam, Idaho, North Dakota, New Hampshire, the U.S. Virgin Is lands, and Wyoming did not distinguish between act ive and i nactive v oters i n their registration records . These states were not required to provide data in item A1c of the EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state le vel wa s used in this calculation. 6  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  7 citizens were registered as active voters for the 2020 general election.9 This is an increase of 3.6 percentage points from the 2016 CVAP active voter registration rate of 84.6. Further details about 9 This report uses the 1 year American Community Survey ACS state estimate for 2019 instead of the 5 year estimate to ensure that the CVAP is as current as possible. The CVAP estimates for 2020 were not available by the time this report was finalized. The a ctive CVAP registration rate was calculated as the total number of active voters A1b of the EAVS divided by CVAP. American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands were not included in this calculation because the U.S. Census Bureau does not calculate a CVAP for these territories. North Dakota was not included Calculating Turnout Rates When assessing election administration, one primary outcome of interest is voter turnout, which is calculated by dividing the number of people who participated in an election by the number of people who could have participated. The EAVS provides a measure of the total number of voters who cast a ballot that was counted in an election item F1a for the numerator in this equation. However, multiple denominators can be used Number of registered voters or active voters . The n umber of people a state reports as registered and eligible to vote A1a in the EAVS. Some states separately report the number of active voters who have no additional processing requirements to fulfill before voting A1b in the EAVS. This number is available for states and sub state EAVS jurisdictions. 1   1  1   100     Citizen voting age population CVAP . The e stimate of the total number of U.S. citizens 18 years of age or older based on the U.S. Census Bureaus ACS. This number is available for states and most substate EAVS jurisdictions but not for U.S. territories , except for Puerto Rico. 1    100     Voting Eligible Population VEP . The m easure of the CVAP minus those who are ineligible to vote such as persons with disqualifying felony convictions and persons who are in the military or citizens living overseas. This number is available for states, but not territories or for sub state jurisdictions. 1    100     Relying on the number of registered or active voters can be problematic for calculating turnout because it is often challenging for states to keep voter regis tration rolls fully up to date see Chapter 3 of this report for a discussion of list maintenance practices. Using VEP as the denominator in turnout calculations would somewhat overrepresent voter turnout since EAVS data explicitly include persons covered by UOCAVA and would restrict the ability to estimate turnout for sub state jurisdictions. Although each denominator has its limitations, the EAC uses CVAP to calculate turnout in this report because of its availability for the majority of jurisdictions that report EAVS data and because it provides a more accurate picture of the population covered by the EAVS. Appendix D of Chapter 5 of this report contains recommendations on how to calculate additional EAVS rates. voter registration, including how voters registered to vote, the use of same day voter registration SDR , and list maintenance, can be found in Chapter 3 of this report. States also reported that a total of 161,303,109 voters cast ballots that were counted for the 2020 general election. This represents a CVAP turnout rate of 67.7 nationwide.10 Turnout for the 2020 general election increased 6.7 percentage points from the 2016 CVAP turnout rate of 61.11 Despite many election administration challenges relat ed to the COVID 19 pandemic, the 2020 election had the highest turnout rate of any EAVS to date. Figure 2 shows that nearly all states experienced higher turnout rates in 2020 than they did for the 2016 general election. Twenty one states had more than 70 of their CVAP cast a ballot that was counted for the 2020 general election only four states had turnout over 70 for the 2016 election . In addition, three states Utah, Hawaii, and Texas had turnout increases of more than 10 percentage points compared to the 2016 g ener al election. The states with the highest turnout increases tended to be those that made mail voting easy for voters. Hawaii and Utah had both enacted all mail elections in 2019 , and Nevada, New Jersey, and Vermont did the same as a temporary measure in res ponse to the COVID 19 pandemic. Arizona, California, Montana, and Washington had already been conducting their elections predominantly or entirely by mail before 2020. Michigan automatically sent mail ed ballot request forms to all registered voters for the 2020 general election. These states, along with Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas, each had turnout increases of more than 8 percentage points from 2016 to 2020. Only one U.S. territory Puerto Rico reported a decrease in turnout since the 2016 g eneral electio n. Another notable finding from the 2020 EAVS was a change in how voters cast their ballots. Historically, the majority of voters have cast their ballots in person at a physical polling place on Election Day . This method of voting was used by 54.5 of voters in 2016 and by 58.2 of voters in 2018. However, in 2020 , the percentage of these voters fell to 30.5. 12 For the first time in EAVS history, a majority of voters did not cast their ballots in person on Election Day in 2020, Election Day inperson voting was less commonly used than mail voting or in person early voting . The nationwide number of voters who vote in person on Election Day has likewise been steadily decreasing, from 72,393,400 in 2016 to 67,133,886 in 2018 and to 47,148,389 in 2020 . This is despite an overall in this c alculation because this state does not have voter registration. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 10 The total n um ber of voters who cast a ballot that wa s counted was reported in item F1a of the EAVS. T he CVAP tu rnout rat e was calculated by di viding F1a by CVAP. A merican Samoa, G uam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Isla nds were not i nclu ded in t his ca lculation because t he U.S. Census B ur eau does not cal culate CV AP for these t erritories. Casewise d eletion at the state level was use d in this c alculation. 11 For the 20 20 EAV S, the question about vote r participation was re worded. In 2 016, this q uestion collected data on ballots cast independent of outcome, whereas in 2020, it collected d ata on ballots c ast and c ounted. Thus, it is likely tha t the 201 6 turnout calculation was higher than it would ha ve be en if the 2020 question wording had been used, thus , und erestimating the true turnout chan ge from 2016 to 2020. 12 Election Day in pers on turnou t w as calculated by dividing the total num b er of E lection Day in person voters w ho cas t a ba llot tha t was counted  ite m F1b of the EAVS by the total n umber of v oters who cas t a ballot that was counted  item F1a. Ore gon and W ashington did not report any in person Election Day voters because these states conduct their elections almost e ntirely by mail. Casewise deletion at the state le vel w as used in this calculation. 8  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  9 Figure 2. Nearly All States Experienced Turnout Increases in the 2020 General Election Source The CVAP turnout was calculated as F1aCVAP x 100 for both 2016 and 2020. American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands were not included , as CVAP is not available for these territories. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating turnout. Change between 2016 and 2020 is measured in percentage points. increase in 2020 in the number of states with a policy that allows for vote centers either on a statewide level or in certain jurisdictions, which allow voters to cast their ballots at any polling location or vote center within their jurisdiction rather than at an assigned polling location. Twenty one states reported allowing vote centers for the 2020 general election compared to 17 states in 2018. 13 The percentage of voters who used a mailed ballot to vote surged, from 24.5  in 2016 and 25. 6 in 2018 to 43.1  in 2020 . The number of voters who used in person early voting also increased from previous years, although the increase was not as large. In 2016, 25.3 of voters cast their ballots early in person , and 22 did so in 2018, compared to 30.6  for the 2020 general election. The Figur e 3. Mail Voting Was the Most Common Way for Voters to Cast Their Ballots in 2020 Sour ce Election Day turnout was calculated as F1bF1a x 100 for all years. Mail turnout was calculated as F1dF1gF1a x 100 for all years. In person early turnout was calculated as F1fF1a x 100 for all years. UOCAVA, provisional, and other turnout was calculated as F1cF1eF1hF1a x 100 for all years. Casewise deletion was used at the state level percentages for each mode of voting were calculated independently , and only states that reported data for a given mode were included in the analysis , and because of this, percentages do not sum to 100. 13 Information on vote center poli cies was provided in Q13 of the 2018 Policy Survey and Q25 of the 2020 Policy Survey. Si x states that did not offer vote centers in 2018 did so in 2020, and two states that offered vote centers in 2018 did not in 2020. 10  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  11 EAVS data confirm that the ways voters cast their ballots changed because of the COVID 19 pandemic. Many states took steps to reduce crowding at in person polling places on Election Day by expanding the use of mail and early voting, and the EAVS data also confirm that voters made use of these options. Figure 3 shows the most commonly used modes of voting for the 2016, 2018, and 2020 general elections. Voting by Mail All states and territories and the District of Columbia off er their citizens the opportunity to cast their ballots by mail in federal general elections, although the number of citizens who cast their ballots using this method and the circumstances under which citizens can vote a mailed ballot vary widely among states. Some states use the term absentee voting instead of mail voting. 14 For purposes of this report, mail voting refer s to the process by which 1.An individual receives a ballot in the mail before the election. In some states or jurisdictions,election offices automatically send a mail ed ballot to all registered voters often referred to as all mail elections , whereas others automatically send mail ed ballots only to individuals on a permanent mail voting list. In other states, individuals must file an application to request a ballot for each election for which they wish to vote a mailed ballot . 15 2.The i ndividual marks the mailed ballot with their preferences at home instead of at an election office or polling location . 3.The individual returns the voted ballot to election officials, typically by sending the votedballot through the mail, by returning the voted ballot to an in person voting site or election office, or by depositing the voted ballot in a secure designated drop box. 16 The options voters have for returning voted mailed ballots are dictated by state policy. The 2020 Policy Survey results show that many states made changes to their mail voting policies since the 2018 g eneral election. However, the Policy Survey did not record precisely when these changes were made , the reason behind the policy changes, or whether the policy changes were permanent or temporary. In 2020, 39 states did not require an excuse for voters to request a mailed ballot  six of these states and one territory Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, South Carolina, Virginia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands required an excuse in 2018 but not in 2020. In addition, 14 states conducted all mail elections. Ten states California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington conducted allmail elections on a statewide basis , and four states did so in select jurisdictions Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, and Nebraska. However, states and jurisdictions that conducted their elections by mail 14 In recognition of th e fact that many states no longer require a person to be absent from their ele ction jurisdiction in order to be permitted to cast a ballot by mail, the EAVS uses the term mail voting . 15 In some states, applications to vote by mail are valid for multiple elections, such as for the duration of a two year election cycle or for all el ections within a calendar year. The 2020 EAVS and Policy Survey did not collect data on how long mail ed ballot applications are valid for. 16 The 2020 EAVS did not collect information on which states used drop boxes , how many drop boxes were in use , or how many ballots were returned via drop boxes. typically also offered some form of in person voting . For a more thorough look at the policies surrounding mail voting, please see Chapter 2, Election Law and Procedure The Policy Survey. States reported that 69,486,96 8 ballots were cast using a mailed ballot and counted for the 2020 general election, more than double the number of ballots cast using a mail ed ballot for the 2016 general election 33,140,080.17 The mail ed ballot voting turnout rate increased by nearly 20 percentage points, from 24.5  in 2016 to 43 .1 in 2020 . Table 1. Jurisd ictions Saw Large Increases in Mail Turnout From 2018 to 2020 Type of Jurisdiction 2018 Average Mail Turnout 2020 Average Mail Turnout Turnout Change Jurisdiction was in a state that introduced a statewide allmail election in 2020 9.9 72.0 62.1 Jurisdiction was in a state that required an excuse for mail voting in 2018 but did not in 2020 5.9 30.8 24.9 Jurisdiction was in a state that did not conduct all mail elections in either 2018 or 2020 11.4 30.6 19.2 Jurisdiction was in a state that did not change its excuse policy for mail voting from 2018 to 2020 10.2 25.8 15.6 Source The mail turnout rate for both 2018 and 2020 was calculated as F1dF1gF1a x 100. Jurisdictions classification on their state s allmail election policy was based on their states responses to Q9a of the 2018 Policy Survey and Q18a of the 2020 Policy Survey jurisdictions in states that had allvote bymail elections in select jurisdictions only were excluded from the analysis of mail voting policies. Jurisdictions policies on whether to require an excuse for mail voting were based on their states responses to Q8 of the 2018 Policy Survey and Q17 of the 2020 Policy Survey jurisdictions in states that conduct all mail elections, either statewide or in select jurisdictions, were excluded from the analysis of mail voting excuse policies. Casewise deletion was used at the jurisdiction level only jurisdictions that reported data in F1d and or F1g as well as reported data in F1a in b oth 2018 and 2020 were included in the analysis. All mail turnout increases from 2018 to 2020 were statistically significant at p  0.001. Jurisdiction level analysis also shows large increases in mail voting from the 2018 to the 2020 general elections a cross a variety of policy configurations, particularly where mail voting was made more widely available. These increases are shown in Table 1. The largest increases occurred in states that did not have all mail elections in 2018 but implemented this type of voting on a statewide level in 2020. Jurisdictions in these states had an average mail turnout level of 9.9 in 2018, which increased to 72 for the 2020 g eneral electionan increase of 62.1 percentage points. The next largest increase occurred in jurisdictions whose states removed the requirement to provide an excuse in order to request a mail ed ballot in 2020. These jurisdictions had an average mail turnout rate of 5.9 in 2018 and 30.8 in 2020, an increase of 24.9 percentage points . States that did not change their policies on all mail elections or excuse required mailed ballot voting also saw increases 17 The total n umber of ma il votes was calculated b y adding the number of v oters w ho c ast a ma iled ballot and w hose ballots were counted item F1d of the EAVS and the number of voters who cas t a mail ed ballot in a jurisdiction that c onducts elections entirely by mail and whos e ballots were c ounted  item F 1g of EAVS.

C as ewise deletion a t the state le vel was used in these calculations. 12  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  13 in their mail voting rates from 2018 to 2020, but these average increases were smaller, at 19.2 percentag e points and 15.6 percentage points, respectively. States reported transmitting a total of 90,687,978 mailed ballots to non UOCAVA voters for the November 2020 general election , of which 70,551,227 were returned by voters. This means that 77.8 of the transmitted mail ed ballots were returned by voters , and of the returned ballots, 98.8  were counted and 0.8 were rejected.18 Although the number of mailed ballots that were transmitted more than doubled since 2016 when 41,651,526 transmitted mail ed ballot s were reported the mailed ballot return, count, and rejection rates were not significantly different between the 2016 and 2020 g eneral elections at the national leve l.19 Table 2 shows the most common reasons reported for rejecting mail ed ballots in the 2020 g eneral election. In this election, rejections for having a non matching signature accounted for nearly one third  32.8  of the total rejected mailed ballots. The next most common reason  22.5  was other, which comprised reasons such as the voter was not eligible to vote in the jurisdiction, the ballot was missing an important document such as an affidavit or certification , the document was incomplete or insufficient, there were identifying marks on the ballot, the ballot was missing a secrecy envelope or was outside of the secrecy envelope, or a combination of reasons.20 Other common reasons for rejection included that the voter had already voted in person  13.5 , the ballot was received after the states deadline for submitting a mailed ballot  12.1 , and there was no voter signature on the mail ed ballot or the mail ed ballot envelope  12.1 . Additional information about mail voting in the 2020 g eneral election, including statistics by state, can be found in Appendix A of this c hapter. 18 The mail ed ballot return rate was calculated by dividing the total number of mail ed ballots returned by voters item C1b of EAVS by the total number of mail ed ballots transmitted item C1a of EAVS. The mail ed ballot count rate was calculated by dividing the number of counted mail ed ballots item C3a by the total number of mail ed ballo ts returned by voters item C1b. The mailed ballot rejection rate was calculated by dividing the total number of mailed ballot s rejected item C4a by the total number of mailed ballot s returned by voters item C1b. A total of 0.4 of the mailed ballot s returned by voters C1b were not classified as having been either counted C3a or rejected C4a. Alabama did not provide sufficient data to calculate the mailed ballot count and rejection rates. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in these cal culations. The EAVS data also show that nationwide, 1.4 of the transmitted mailed ballot s were returned as undeliverable C1cC1a 3.6 were surrendered, spoiled, or replaced C1dC1a 0.5 were surrendered at the polls , so the voter could cast a provis ional ballot C1eC1a 16.8 had an unknown status, which include d voters who were transmitted a mailed ballot but chose not to vote C1fC1a and 1 of mailed ballot s reached some other status C1gC1hC1iC1a. Casewise deletion at the state level wa s used in these calculations. 19 The comparisons were statistically insignificant at p  0.05. 20 In the 2020 EAVS, states reported other reasons for rejecting mailed ballots in items C4pOther , C4qOther , and C4tOther. 14  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Table 2. The Most Common Reason for Rejecting Mail ed Ballots Was for a Non Matching Signature Reason Percentage of Rejected Ballots Nonmatching signature 32.8  Other reason given 22.5  Voter already voted in person 13.5 Ballot not received on timemissed deadline 12.1 No voter signature 12.1 No witness signature 5.6 Ballot returned in an unofficial envelope 4.2 Multiple ballots returned in one envelope 2.1 Firsttime voter without proper identification 2.0 Voter deceased 1.6 Ballot missing from envelope 1.5 Envelope not sealed 0.9 No resident address on envelope 0.8 No ballot application on record 0.6 No election officials signature on ballot 0.1 Sour ce Rejections for non matching signature was calculated as C4eC4a x 100. Rejections for other reasons was calculated as C4pC4qC4rC4a x 100. Rejections because the voter already voted in person was calculated as C4mC4a x 100. Rejections because the ballot was not received on time was calculated as C4bC4a x 100. Rejections because the ballot lacked a voter signature was calculated as C4cC4a x 100. Rejections because the ballot lacked a witness signature was calculated as C4dC4a x 100. Rejections because the ballot was in an unofficial envelope was calculated as C4gC4a x 100. Rejections because multiple ballots were returned in a single envelope was calculated as C4kC4a x 100. Rejections because the first time voter did not provide proper identification was calculated as C4nC4a x 100. Rejections because the ballot was from a deceased voter was calculated as C4lC4a x 100. Rejections because the ballot was missing from the envelope was calculated as C4hC4a x 100. Rejections because the envelope was not sealed was calculated as C4iC4a x 100. Rejections because there was no resident address on the envelope was calculated as C4jC4a x 100. Rejections because there was no ballot application on record was calculated as C4oC4a x 100. Rejections because there was no election officials signature on the ballot was calculated as C4fC4a x 100. Casewise deletion was used at the state level percentages for each rejection reason were calculated independently and only states that repo rted data for a given reason were included in the analysis , and because of this, percentages do not sum to 100. InPerson Voting Before Election Day Most states allow some kind of in person voting before Election Day. This type of voting generally falls into two categories A voter may go to a polling place before Election Day, receiv e a ballot, vot e their ballot while at the polling place, and place their completed ballot into a ballot box or tabulator.Overview of Election Administration and Voting  15 A voter may go to an election office to pick up a ballot ove r the counter. In some states, the voter may be able to take their ballot home with them, whereas in other states , the ballot must be completed in the office. The ballot is then sealed in an envelope and tabulated along with ballots that are returned to th e office by mail according to local procedures. The type of in person voting that takes place before Election Day and the populations that may use this method of voting are determined by state law. Different states use the terms in person early voting and in person absentee voting to describe both of the voting methods described above, although other terms exist as well see Chapter 2 of this report .21 Some states offer both types of voting acti vities. For example, voters in Ohio may go to their countys designated early voting site, vote in person, and cast their ballot on a direct recording electronic device or scan their ballot in a precinct scanner. Voters also have the option of completing a ballot request form, picking up a ballot from their countys election office, and returning their ballot in person, by drop box, or by mail at a later date. Fifty five of the states and territories all but New Jersey  reported offering some form of in person voting before Election Day to their population for the 2020 g eneral election. Of these states, 12 required voters to provide an approved excuse to cast an early ballot , and 43 states allowed for no  excuse early voting. 22 Overall, three more states offered no excuse early voting for the 2020 general election compared to the 2018 general election . Further details about state policies on early voting can be found in Chapter 2 of this report . For the 2020 general election , states reported that 41,266,229 ballots were cast through in person early voting and were counted, a 71.1  increase compared to the number cast by this method for the 2016 g eneral election 24,124,466. Although the rate of early voting increased from 2016 to 2020, from 25.3 to 30. 6, the rate of increase was not as large as it was for mail voting.23 It should be noted that some states may have repo rted mail ed ballots returned via drop box with other early ballots. Currently, the EAVS does not collect data on the number of ballots returned via drop box, and some states data collection practices do not distinguish between early ballots and ballots returned via a drop box. 21 The EAVS questions use the term in person early voting to refer to all types of in person voting that take place before Election Day. The question instructions specify that in person absentee voting should be reported as in person early voting in EAVS d ata. However, some states data management systems do not distinguish in person absentee voters from mail voters, so not all states with in person absentee voting were able to report data on how many of their voters voted in this way. 22 The terminology a s tate used to refer to the process of allowing individuals to cast their ballots in person before Election Day was collected in item Q24 of the 2020 Policy Survey. Data on whether a state required a voter to provide an excuse to cast a ballot in person before Election Day was collected in item Q24a. 23 The total number of in person early ballots cast and counted was collected in item F1f of the EAVS. The early voting turnout rate was calculated by dividing this figure by the to tal number of ballots that were cast and counted item F1a of the EAVS. Alabama, Connecticut, Iowa, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island did not report data in F1f, either because they did not o ffer inperson early voting in the case of New Jersey or because the number of in person early voters could not be tracked separately from other modes of participation. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. Provisional Voting HAVA introduced provisional voting as a way for a voter to cast a ballot when the voters registration status cannot be verified at the time of voting, when there is some indication the voter may have already cast another ballot for instance, by mail , or when the voters eligibility to vote is challenged . Provisional ballots are kept separate from other election ballots and are later fully counted, partially counted, or rejected depending on whether the provisional voters eligibility can be verified in the days following the election according to the states rules for this process . The provisional ballot process helps ensure each qualified voter casts only one ballot that is counted and allows the voter addition al time to prove their eligibility to vote if necessary. Certain states are exempt from HAVAs provisional ballot requirements because they allowed SDR at the time the law was enacted. In addition, North Dakota is exempt from this provision of HAVA because it does not require citizens to register to vote. In the 2020 Policy Survey, 49 states and territories and the District of Columbia reported offering provisional ballots to voters. Five states and one territory Idaho, Minnesota, North Dakota, New Hampshir e, Vermont , and Puerto Ricodid not. 24 States reported that the most common reasons for offering a voter a provisional ballot included that an election official challenged a voters eligibility to vote 46 states , the voter was not on the list of eligible voters 43 states, the voter lacked proper identification  40 states , the voter did not reside in the precinct in which they were attempting to vote 40 states , and another person not an election officer challenged a voters eligibility to vo te 28 states .25 If a voter cast a provisional ballot in the wrong precinct, four states reported that they would fully count the entire ballot, 20 states would partially count the ballot e.g., only count the items on the ballot for which the voter would have been eligible had they voted in the correct precinct, and 26 states would reject the entire ballot.26 For more information on provisional voting policies, including the deadlines by which provisional ballots needed to be adjudicated, please see Chapter 2 of this report. States reported 1,316,945 provisional ballots were cast and counted for the 2020 g eneral election. This represents a slight decline from previous years  1,483,708 provisional ballots had been cast in 2018 and 1,897,631 in 2016. Provis ional voting as a percentage of turnout has continued its rate of decline in presidential elections, from 1.7 in 2012 to 1.4 in 2016 to 0.8 in 2020. 27 The rate of provisional voting declined twice as fast between the 2016 and the 2020 general elections as it did between the 2012 and the 2016 general elections. 24 Information on s t ates use of provisional voting was collected i n Q32 of the 2020 P olicy S u rvey. 25 In formation on the circumstances under which a state uses provisional ballots was collected in Q32a of the 2020 Policy Survey. 26 Information on how a state w o uld treat a pro visional ballot cast in the wrong precinct wa s collected i n Q32c. Percentages w ere calculated u sing the number of s tates who repor ted u sing pr ovisional v oti ng in Q 3 2. 27 The tot al n umber of provisional b allots cast a nd counted was collected in it em F1e of the EAVS. The provisional voting turnout rate was calculated b y dividing this figure by the total number of b a llots that were cast and c ou nted  item F1a of t he EAVS. I d aho, Minnesota, N orth Dakota, N ew Hampshire, and V er mont d id not rep ort d ata on provisional ballots in the 2 020 EAVS because, as confirmed in the Policy Survey, these states do not offer provisional ballots to voters. Puerto Rico reported in the Pol icy S urvey that it does not offer p r ovisional ballots bu t reported d ata o n provisional ballots in the E AVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 16  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  17 Nationally, 78.3 of provisional ballots were counted,28 either in full or in part, with 21.3 being rejected.29 The most common reasons that states reported for rejecting provisional ballots included that the voter was not registered in the state accounting for 54.8 of rejections, other reasons 21.2, the voter attempted to vote in the wrong jurisdiction  12.4, the voter had already cast a ballot through another mode of voting  5, the voter attempt ed to vote in the wrong precinct  4.8, the voter fail ed to provide sufficient identification  3.4, the envelope or ballot was incomplete or illegible  3.3 , and the voters signature did not match the signature on record  2.2.30 Furthermore, 0.9  of the provisional ballots reached another adjudication aside from being either counted or rejected  the largest numbers of these ballots came from Ohio, Texas, Missouri, and Illinois.31 UOCAVA and Other Modes of Voting Absentee and mail voting have long been used to provide individuals in the military or U.S. citizens who live overseas or who are absent from their residence with a way to participate in federal elections. The d istinct needs of members of the uniformed services and overseas citizen s remain an area of critical concern in election administration, and these individuals are given special voting protections under UOCAVA and its amendments. 32 UOCAVA voters are provided certain rights to fully 28 The total number of counted provisional ballots was calculated by summing the number of provisional ballots fully counted item E1b of the EAVS and the number of provisional ballots partially counted item E1c. The percentage of counted provisional ballots was calculated by dividing the sum of E1b and E1 c by the sum of all provisional ballot adjudications items E1b, E1c, E1 d, and E1e. Maine reported in its EAVS survey comments that all provisional ballots are counted. The data that New Jersey reported in E1e provisional ballots that reached another adjudication were included in this calculation, because the state explained in its survey comments that this item included provisional ballots that were accepted in part or in full. The data that El Dorado, San Bernardino, and Stanislaus counties in California reported in E1e were included in this calculation for the same reason. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in these calculations. 29 The total number of rejected provisional ballots was collected in item E1d of the EAVS. The percentage of rejec ted provisional ballots was calculated by dividing this figure by the sum of all provisional ballot adjudications items E1b, E1c, E1d, and E1e. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 30 The number of provisional ballots rejected because the voter was not registered in the state was collected in item E2b of the EAVS. The number of provisional ballots rejected because the voter attempted to vote in the wrong jurisdiction was collected in item E2c. The number of provisional ballots rejected be cause the voter attempted to vote in the wrong precinct was collected in item E2d. The number of provisional ballots rejected because the voter did not provide sufficient identification was collected in item E2e. The number of provisional ballots rejected because the envelope andor ballot were incomplete or illegible was collected in item E2f. The number of provisional ballots rejected because the voters signature did not match the signature on record w as collected in item E2i. The percentage of provisional ballots rejected for each of these reasons was calculated by dividing the figure by the total number of provisional ballots rejected item E2a. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in these calculations. 31 The total number of provisional ballots that reached an adjudication aside from being counted or rejected was collected in item E1e of the EAVS. The percentage of other provisional ballots was calculated by dividing this fig ure by the sum of all provisional ballot adjudications items E1b, E1c, E1d, and E1e. As explained in footnote 28, the E1e data for the state of New Jersey and the counties of El Dorado, San Bernardino, and Stanislaus in California were included in the calculation for counted provisional ballots. Ohio explained in its survey comments that this data included provisional ballots cast under an APRI exception but did not provide a definition for this term . Missouri explained in its survey comments that this da ta included provisional ballots supplied to voters who were registered but did not have a form of identification. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 32 The uniformed services are the armed forces the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard as we ll as the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, and the U.S. Merchant Marine. Uniformed services members, their spouses, and th eir eligible dependents are, together, referred to as uniformed services voters. Overseas citizens are U.S. citizens living outside of the United States who are not uniformed services voters and are also protected by UOCAVA. participate in federal elections and are given special considerations as to when their ballots are sent, how their blank ballots can be transmitted, and how and when they may return their voted ballots. For the 2020 g eneral election, states reported 938,297 UOCAVA ballots that were cast and counted. This total represent s a sizeable increase from 2016 and 2018, when 649,427 and 358,137 UOCAVA ballots were cast, respectively. However, despite the increase in the number of voters who participated in the 2020 g eneral election, UOCAVA voting as a percentage of the overall electorate stayed relatively the same in 2020. In 2016, 0.5 of voters were UOCAVA voters, and in 2020 , UOCAVA voters comprised 0.6  of the electorate.33 Nationwid e, 97.6  of the UOCAVA absentee ballots that were returned by voters were counted , and 2.1 of the returned ballots were rejected.34 Chapter 4 of this report contains a complete discussion of the EACs history of collecting data on voters covered by UOCAVA  a full analysis of the data collected about these voters and their ballots in 2020, including ballots transmitted, returned, counted, and rejected  and the use of the Federal Write In Absentee Ballot FWAB. Chapter 2 of this report contains a complete discussion of state policies regarding UOCAVA voting. In addition to ballots that were cast at a physical polling place on Election Day, by mail, by in person early voting, and by provisional voting, states had the opportunity to report data on any other modes of voting that were offered in the state in 2020 . 35 A total of 1, 290,577 ballots were reported as cast and counted that could not be categorized according to one of the modes listed in the EAVS question . The highest numbers of these votes were reported in California  923,698 ballots, Florida 184,533 ballots, North Carolina  168,900 ballots, and Wisconsin  7,387 ballots. The most common reasons for reporting data in this item included mail ed ballots that could not be distinguished as being fro m UOCAVA or non UOCAVA voters, conditional voter registration CVR voters in California, curbside absentee voters in North Carolina, and other, unknown, or not categorized ballots. Polling Places and Poll Workers For an election, each voter is assigned to a precinct according to their residential address as listed in their voter registration record. A precinct is a contiguous, bounded geographic area that is the basis for determining the contests and issues on which the voters legally residing in that area are eligible to vote. 36 Precincts are then assigned to a polling place, which is a physical location where in person voting takes place. As previously discussed, some states use an early voting or vote center model 33 The tot al n umber of UOCAVA b allots t hat w ere cast a nd counted was collected in item F1c of the E AVS. The UOCAVA turnout rate was calculated b y dividing this figure by the total number of b a llots that were cast and c ou nted  i tem F1a of t he EAVS. Rhode Island did not report d at a i n F1c. Their survey c omme nt stat e d, According to R I ge neral l aw, all UOCAVA mail ballots are consolidated i n to on e mail ballot c a tegory. C asewise de letion at the sta te level was used i n this calculation. 34 The total n u mber of U O C AVA absentee ballots that were returned by voters was collected in item B9 a of the EAVS. The number of UO CAVA ba llots counted wa s collected i n item B14a, and the number of UOCAVA ballots rejected was collected i n item B 18a. T he UOCAVA ballot cou nt r ate was calculated by dividing B 14a by B9a, and the rejection rate was calculated by dividing B 18a by B9a. Casewise d e letion at th e st ate level was used i n this calculat ion this calculation also did not i nclude re t urned UOCAVA ba l lo ts that were not categorized as either counted or rejected. 35 Ba llots cast by an other mode that were counted were recorded i n item F1h of the EAVS. 36 Some states u se the terms ward or voting district to describe their voting precincts. 18  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  19 that allows voters to vote at any polling location within their jurisdiction rather than at a specifically assigned polling place. States reported 176,933 precincts that were used for the 2020 general election. States reported that 107,457 polling places w ere used on Election Day and that 25,099 polling places were used during the early voting period, for a total of 132,556 polling places for the 2020 g eneral election.37 States also provided information on whether their polling places were located at election offices or at other sites, such as libraries, schools, or mobile voting locations. There continues to be differences in where states locate their early voting polling locations, as opposed to their Election Day polling locations. States reported that nationwide, 42.8 of early voting sites were located at election offices , and 57.3 were located at other sites. 38 However, for Election Day polling places, only 9.6  of polling places were located at election offices , and 93.8 were reported as being located at other sites.39 Many of the laws, rules, policies, and procedures governing elections are enforced, in practice, by the poll workers who assist with elections. 40 These poll workers are typically not full time election work ers or employees of election offices rather, they are recruited and trained to assist in the voting process during an election. Typical activities that poll workers assist in include verifying the identities 37 The total number of precincts was collected in item D2a of the EAVS. The total number of Election Day polling places was collected in item D3a. The total number of early voting polling places was collected in item D4a. Kansas and Washington did not provide data on the number of Election Day polling places. Connecticut, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Oregon did not provide data on the number of early voting polling places several of these states noted that early voting opportunities are limited to special circumstances , so the number of early voting sites was not tracked. Before this reports finalization, Virginia notified the EAC that the statewide number of early voting polling places in D4a was 208, not 133. Data users should note that the question numbering in this section changed in 2020 these questions were numbered differently in the 2016 and 2018 EAVS. However, a yearoveryear analysis of polling places as reported in the EAVS is cautioned against, as these items have been underreported in previous years. 38 The number of early voting polling places located at election offices was collected in item D4c of the EAVS. The number of early voting polling places located at other sites was collected in item D4b of the EAVS. The percentage of early voting polling locations located at each type of site was calculated by dividing the EAVS item by the sum of D4b and D4c. This denominator was used instead of the reported total number of early voting polling locations item D4a , because some states provided a total in D4a but not a breakdown in D4b and D4c. Of the states that reported offering in person early voting, Connecticu t, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Wisconsin did not provide any data on early voting polling places in D4a, D4b, or D4c. Several of these states noted in their survey comments that early voting was offered only in very limi ted circumstances. Georgia and Rhode Island provided data on the total number of early voting polling places in D4a but did not provide a data breakdown i n D4b and D4c. New Jersey did not provide data because it did not offer in person early voting. Casewi se deletion at the state level was used in these calculations , and because each category was calculated independently, the percentages do not sum to 100. 39 The number of Election Day polling places located at election offices was collected in item D3c of the EAVS. The number of Election Day polling places located at other sites was collected in item D3b of the EAVS. The percentage of Election Day polling locations located at each type of site was calculated by dividing the EAVS item by the sum of D 3b and D3c. This denominator was used instead of the reported total number of Election Day polling locations item D3a , because some states provided a total in D3a but not a breakdown in D3b and D3c. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in these calculations , and because each category was calculated independently, the percentages do not sum to 100. Of the states that reported offering in person early voting, Kansas and Washington did not provide any data on Election Day polling places in D3a, D3 b, or D3c  Washington noted that data were not provided because the state votes almost entirely by mail. The District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, the Northern Mariana Islands, Ohio, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, and the U.S. Virgin Islands provided data on the total number of Election Day polling places in D3a but did not provide a data breakdown in D3b and D3c. 40 Some states and jurisdictions use other titles for poll workers, such as election judges, booth workers, wa rdens, or commissioners. The EAVS instructions stated that observers stationed at polling places, regular office staff who did not fulfill poll worker functions during the election, or temporary election staff who were not hired specif ically to serve voter s in either early or Election Day voting should not be counted as poll workers for purposes of the EAVS. of those who come to vote, assisting voters wit h signing documents required to cast a ballot , providing ballots and setting up voting equipment , and performing other functions as dictated by the state or local election authority. States reported the number of early voting and Election Day poll workers separately, and they also reported the total number of poll workers who assisted with the 2020 g eneral election. States reported that a total of 775,101 poll workers assisted with the 2020 g eneral election. This included 690,346 poll workers who assisted w ith Election Day voting and 135,105 poll workers who assisted with early voting.41 Among states that reported data on poll workers for both the 2016 and the 2020 EAVS, there was no statistically significant change in the number of poll workers reported.42 Thirty six states also reported information on the ages of their poll workers.43 Among these states, the majority of poll workers were over the age of 40 in the 2020 general election, with nearly half of them over 60 years old. However, Figure 4, which compares the age distribution of poll workers in the 2016 general election to those in the 2020 general election, shows slight but statistically significant shifts in the age categories over time. I n 2020 , the percentage of poll workers who were ages 18 to 25 and 26 to 40 increased , and the percentage of poll workers who were ages 61 to 70 and 71 or older decreased compared to 2016.44 Notably, the percentage of poll workers who were ages 26 to 40 nearly doubled, from 8 in 2016 to 15 in 2020 . 41 The total num ber of poll workers who assisted with the 2020 general election was collected in item D7a of the EAVS. The total number of poll workers who a ssisted wi th Election Day vot i ng wa s collected i n item D5. T he total n umb er of pol l work ers who assisted wi th early vot ing wa s collected in item D6. D7a does not match the sum of D5 and D6, because in D7a, each pol l worker wa s to o nly be c ounted o nce even if they assisted with both e arly voting and Election Day voting. O regon, P ennsylvania, P uerto R ico, Vermont, W ashington, and W isconsin were unable to provide poll w orker d ata. A labama, Connecticut, L ouisiana, M aine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey , and North D akota did not provide data on the number of early v oting p oll w or kers. North D akota di d not provide data on the number of Election Day poll workers. N ew Hampshire provided d ata on the minimum number of poll workers re qui red at each polling l ocation b y law b ut not ed that it may n ot reflect the number of pol l wor kers w ho actually a ssisted. 42 T tests conducted on the national number of poll workers in 2016 and 2020 were statistically i nsignifican t at p  0.05. 43 Poll worker a ge data were reported i n it em D7 of the EAVS for 2020, with D7a cor r esponding t o the tot al n u mber of poll w orkers who assisted w i th the 2020 general election and i tems D7bD7g cor responding t o age ca t egories. T h e denominator used in this calculation was the sum of the age categories in D7bD7g. Poll worker age data were reported in i tems D3 and D4 for 2016, with D3a corresponding to t he total number of poll workers and items D4aD4f corresponding to age categories. The denominator used in this calculation was the sum of the age categories in D4aD4f. In 2020, South Carolina on l y r eported poll workers w ho were under t he age of 18 and did not provide da t a for any other ag e categories . South C ar ol ina was excluded from the calculations of the percentage of poll workers by age. Connecticut, Georgia, Ha w aii, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusett s, Minnesota , New Hampshire, New Jersey, N o rth D a kota, the Northern Ma r iana Islands, O regon, Pennsylvania, Puerto R ico, Rhode Island, the U.S. Vi r gin Is lands, Ve rmont, Virginia, Washington, and Wi sconsin were unable to provide data on the ages of their poll workers. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in these calculations . 44 T tests conducted that compared t he percentage of poll workers in the 18 to 25, 26 to 40, 61 to 70, and 71 or older age categories between 2016 and 2020 were s tati stically significant at p  0.05, with most be i ng p  0.01. Other a g e groups di d not have a statistically significant change. 20  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  21 Figure 4. Poll Worker Age Distribution W as Slightly Younger in 2020 Than in 2016 Sou rce The percentage of poll workers under age 18 was calculated as D7bD7bD7cD7dD7eD7fD7g x 100 for 2020 and D4aD4aD4bD4cD4dD4eD4f x 100 for 2016. The percentage of poll workers age s 18 25 was calculated as D7cD7bD7cD7dD7eD7fD7g x 100 for 2020 and D4bD4aD4bD4cD4dD4eD4f x 100 for 2016. The percentage of poll workers age s 26 40 was calculated as D7dD7bD7cD7dD7eD7fD7g x 100 for 2020 and D4cD4aD4bD4cD4dD4eD4f x 100 for 2016. The percentage of poll workers age s 41 60 was calculated as D7dD7bD7cD7dD7eD7fD7g x 100 for 2020 and D4dD4aD4bD4cD4dD4eD4f x 100 for 2016. The percentage of poll workers age s 61 70 was calculated as D7eD7bD7cD7dD7eD7fD7g x 100 for 2020 and D4eD4aD4bD4cD4dD4eD4f x 100 for 2016. The percentage of poll workers age s 71 or older was calculated as D7gD7bD7cD7dD7eD7fD7g x 100 for 2020 and D4fD4aD4bD4cD4dD4eD4f x 100 for 2016. Casewise deletion was used at the state level percentages for each age category were calculated independently and only states that reported data for a given age category were included in the analysis , and because of this, percentages do not sum to 100. The survey comments many jurisdictions provided indicated that this age shift was partially attributable to the COVID 19 pandemic. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC stated that older adults are at greater risk of severe illness from COVID 19, with adults 65 years or older in the highest risk category. This risk category overlaps with the group of adults who ty pically make up the majority of poll workers in federal general elections. The 2020 EAVS data confirm that a number of older poll workers did not assist with the 2020 g eneral election and that many younger adults took their places. The COVID 19 pandemic also affected state and local efforts to obtain a sufficient number of poll workers to assist with the 2020 g eneral election. Although poll worker recruitment remains a challenge, with 52  of jurisdictions reporting that it was either very difficult or somewhat difficult to obtain a sufficient number of poll workers, Figure 5 shows that poll worker recruitment has gotten less difficult since the 2016 g eneral election.45 In their survey comments, many jurisdictions cited cross cutting effects on their recruitment efforts. Some long time poll workers who had served in previous elections were unable to do so for the 2020 g eneral election some were unable to work because of agerelated COVID 19 risks, and in many cases, jurisdictions needed to replace workers who called out sick close to the election to quarantine after COVID 19 exposure. On the other hand, many jurisdiction officials praised the efforts of the EAC and state election offices that encouraged Figure 5 . Poll Worker Recruitment W as Less Difficult in 2020 Than in 2016 Sourc e Ease of recruiting poll workers was collected in item D8 in the 2020 EAVS and D5 in the 2016 EAVS. For both years, jurisdictions that responded , not enough information to answer , data not available , does not apply , or left this item blank were excluded from this analysis. 45 Data on the ease of recruiting poll workers were collected in item D8 of the 2020 EAVS and item D5 of the 2016 EAVS. In 2 020, 3 ,436 of 6, 460 jurisdictions 53.2 re sponded not enough information to answer, data not available, does not apply, or left this item blank. The comparison between 2016 and 2020 data was statistically significant at p  0.01. 22  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  23 qualified individuals to sign up as poll workers. Some jurisdictions noted that they had overwhelming interest from those who view assisting with elections as a way to help their community and recruited more poll workers than they had available slots to fill. Notably, ease of poll worker recruiting appears to be highly correlated with the size of the jurisdiction. Jurisdictions that had 10,000 or fewer registered voters reported having an easier time recruiting poll workers than did jurisdictions with more than 10,000 registered v oters. 46 Election Technology The use of technology in polling places and vote tally locations varies widely across and within the states. The EAVS collects data on the type of voting equipment that is used and the type of voting that the equipment is used for, the specific makes and models of the equipment and how many are deployed, and whether electronic poll books or e poll books are used to assist at polling places. The voting equipment landscape continues to evolve with each election. Voting Equipment The EAVS collects data on the use of six types of voting equipment that voters can use to cast their ballots47 Direct recording electronic DRE voting equipment, not equipped with a voter verified paper audit trail VVPAT48 DRE v oting equipment , equipped with a VVPAT49 Elect ronic system that produces a paper record but does not tabulate votes. These are often referred to as ballot marking devices BMD50 Scanne r opticaldigital that tabulates paper records that voters mark by hand or via a ballot marking device51 46 For this comparison, jurisdictions were classified accord ing to the total number of registered voters as reported in item A1a of the EAVS. This comparison was statistically significant at p  0.001. 47 Two jurisdictions in Arkansas and 21 jurisdictions in Kansas did not provide any information about their voting equipment in the EAVS. Two jurisdictions in Missouri did not provide responses on the use of DREs with VVPAT F6 in the EAVS, and an additional jurisdict ion in Missouri did not provide responses on the use of ballot marking devices  BMD  F7 in the EAVS o r scanners F8 in the EAVS. Five jurisdictions in Texas did not provide responses on the use of DREs without VVPAT F5 in the EAVS, DREs with VVPAT, BMDs, or scanners. Twenty six jurisd ictions in Utah responded data not available to questions about BMDs , and one responded data not available to questions about scanners F8 in the EAVS. In Vermont , 101 jurisdictions responded does not apply to questions about scanners, and 145 jurisdictions did not provide responses to questions about hand counting ballots F11 in the EAVS. No jurisdiction s in Kansas provided responses to questions about the use of BMDs or hand counting ballots. Two jurisdictions Maine  UOCAVA and Kalawao County, Hawaii responded does not apply to all of these questions however, that is because these jurisdictions report EAVS data with other jurisdictions in their state see Chapter 5 for more details. 48 Data on DREs without VVPAT were collected in item s F5a, F5b, F5c, and F5d of the EAVS. 49 Data on DREs with VVPAT were collected in items F6a, F6b, F6c, and F6d of the EAVS. 50 Data on BMDs were collected in items F7a, F7b, F7c, and F7d of the EAVS. 51 Data on scanners were collected in items F8a, F8b, F8c, and F8d of the EAVS. Punch card machines52 Lever mac hines53 The EAVS also collects information on whether jurisdictions hand count paper ballots without the use of an optical or digital scanning system.54 Figure 6. Scanners and BMDs W ere the Most Commonly Used Voting Methods in 2020 Source The use of scanners was collected in item F8a of the 2020 EAVS. Use of BMDs was collected in item F7a. Use of hand counting was collected in item F11a. Use of DRE with VVPAT was collected in item F6a. Use of DRE without VVPAT was collected in item F5a. States in which at least one EAVS jurisdiction reported using the voting equipment are included in this graph. Kansas did not respond to F7a or F11a. 52 Data on punch c ard m achines were collected in items F9 a, F9 b, F9 c, an d F9 d of the EAVS. No jurisdictio ns have reported using this eq uipment since befor e the 2016 EAVS. 53 Data on lever machines were collected in it ems F10a, F10b, F10c, and F10d of the EAVS. No jurisdiction s ha ve reported using t his e quipment since before t he 2016 EAVS. 54 Data on hand counting paper ballots were collected in items F11a and F11d of the EAVS. 24  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview of Election Administration and Voting  25 Nationally, states reported deploying 369,366 pieces of voting equipment to cast and tabulate votes for the 2020 g eneral election.55 Figure 6 shows the number of states that reported using voting equipment in at least one jurisdiction . Most jurisdictions and states used mor e than one type of equipment. The most commonly used types of equipment were scanners  used in 55 states  and BMDs used in 45 states . Twenty one states reported hand counting ballots without using any equipment to assist, and 20 states used DREs equipped with a VVPAT. The use of DREs without VVPAT has been a particular concern to some experts , because these machines do not include a paper record of the votes that are cast, which raises security issues and can make it difficult to conduct certain t ypes of post election audits. In the 2018 EAVS, 14 states reported using DREs without VVPAT in at least one of their jurisdictions. The 2020 EAVS data show that only nine states now use this equipment in at least one of their jurisdictions Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Texas . Of these states, Louisiana reported using DREs without VVPAT in each of its jurisdictions. Five states that reported using DREs without VVPAT in 2018 discontinued using those m achines by the 2020 g eneral election Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. Table 3. D RE Without VVPAT Only Jurisdictions Declined Between 2018 and 2020 State 2018 2020 Number of Jurisdictions Percentage of Jurisdictions Number of Jurisdictions Percentage of Jurisdictions Arkansas 1 1.3 0  Indiana 16 17.4 12 13.0 Kansas 7 6.7 0  Kentucky 5 4.2 0  Pennsylvania 50 74.6 0  Tennessee 6 6.3 1 1.1 Texas 32 12.6  19 7.5 Source The number of jurisdictions that reported using only DRE without VVPAT voting machines was based on responses to items F5a, F6a, F7a, and F8a of the 2018 and 2020 EAVS. The percentage of jurisdictions using only DRE without VVPAT was calculated by dividing by the total number of jurisdictions in the state. One county in Florida that reported using a DRE without VVPAT in 2018 was not included in this table , because the county had listed a make and model of a scanner in item F5b1 in its 2018 data, which indicates a possible data entry error. None of the counties in Kansas that did not provide voting equipment information for the 2020 EAVS reported using DREs without VVPAT in the 2018 EAVS. 55 The number of voting machines deployed was reported in items F5c1, F5c2, F5c3, F6c1, F6c2, F6c3, F7c1, F7c2, F7c3, F8c1, F8c2, F8c3, F9c1, F9c2, F9c3, F10c1, F10c2, and F10c3 of the EAVS. These items were summed for each jurisdiction to arrive at this tota l. American Samoa did not report the number of voting machines deployed, because this territory only uses hand marked paper ballots that are manually counted. Oregon and Wisconsin reported that they do not track the number of voting machines deployed. Before this reports finalization, Virginia notified the EAC that the statewide number of BMD s in F7c1, F7c2, and F7c3 was 2,533 , not data not available . The number of jurisdictions that reported using only DREs wit hout VVPAT and not using any other type of voting equipment also declined between 2018 and 2020. Table 3 shows that for the 2020 general election, only three states reported having jurisdictions that used only DREs without VVPAT as their voting equipment, and in each of those states , the percentage of their jurisdictions that used only DRE without VVPAT has also decreased since 2018. Electronic Poll Books When voters go into polling places, their identity is checked against voter registration information that is contained in poll books to ensure they are registered to vote and did not already cast a ballot during in person early voting or with a mail ed ballot. These poll books can be paper based and printed before the election, or they can be electronic. The use of e poll books has steadily increased in recent elections. For the 2016 general election, 1,146 jurisdictions 17.7 reported using epoll books this number rose to 1,684 26.1 in 2018 and to 1,991 30.8 in 2020. The number of jurisdictions that used e poll books in 2020 represents an 18.2 increase from 2018. As of the 2020 general election, 38 states reported using e poll books in at least one of their jurisdictions, and 16 states and territories Arizona, Delaware, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Distri ct of Columbia reported using e poll books in all of their jurisdictions. Of the jurisdictions that reported using e poll books, the most common usages were to sign voters in at polling places 98.9, update voter history 87.8, and look up polling plac es 79.5, and 20.7 of jurisdictions reported using e poll books for other uses as well. 56 The 2020 Policy Survey also collected information on whether states have a testing or certification process in place for e poll books. 57 Of the 39 states that provided a response to this question, 12 states 30.8 indicated that the testing and certification process is required by statute, 10 states 25.6 indicated that the testing and certification process is required by a formal administrative rule or as guidance, and 17 states 43.6 indicated that testing and certification of e poll books is not required. 58 The EAC does not currently provide testing or certification of e poll books any testing that states perform on their equipment is performed to the states specifications. 56 Use of epoll books to sign vot ers in was reported i n item F3a of the EAVS. Use of e poll books to u pdate voter hi story was reported in i tem F 3b. Use of epoll books t o look up polling pl aces was reported in item F3c. Use of e poll books fo r other purposes was reported in item F3d . A jurisdiction was con sidered to have used e poll b ooks in 2020 if it responded  yes to at least one of these items. 57 Q 16 of the 2020 Policy Survey collected information on w hether the state, or any jurisdiction in the state, used epoll books .

Overview Table 1 Data Notes  General Notes Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating national percentages. The perce ntage calculations at the national level U.S. Total only used data from those states that provided data for the numerator and denominator of the calculation. For example, since there was no CVAP estimate for most U.S. territories, their turnout data F1a  were not used for the calculation of Turnout as  of CVAP at the national level.Overview of Election Administration and Voting  31 The CVAP is an estimate of the number of U.S. citizens 18 years of age or older in the state. This report used the 1 year American Community Survey ACS state estimate for 2019 instead of the 5year estimate to ensure that the CVAP was as current as possible. The estimate for the year 2020 was not available by the time this report was finalized. The 2019 1 year CVAP does not include data that were collected as part of the decennial Census conducted in 2020. Some states may have reported more active registered voters than CVAP because the 2019 CVAP is being compared to 2020 data. The Total Voter Turnout column includes voters who cast a ballot that was counted. The Total Mailed Ballots Cast and Counted column does not include UOCAVA voters. 1Alabama, Connecticut, Iowa, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island did not r epor t data in F1f , because the number of in person early voters could not be tracked separately from other modes of participation. 2American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands d id not have a CVAP available to use for the turnout as a percentage of CVAP calculation. 3For Hawaii, the numbers reported for the City and County of Honolulu include all mailed ballot en velop es received and validated by the county. Certified turnout results were determined through subsequent ballot envelope processing and counting by the State of Hawaii, pursuant to Hawaii State Law. 4Kansas did not provide data on polling places. 5Michigan n oted in its survey comments that  walk in ab sentee voting prior to Election Day is considered early voting in Michigan . These absentee ballots are not tabulated until Election Day. Data on these walk in absentee voters was reported in F1f. 6New Hampshire provided information on the minimum number of early voting and Election Day poll w orker s required by law but noted that it may not reflect the number of poll workers actually deployed. 7New Jersey did not report data in F1f , becau se the state did not offer in person early voting. 8North Dakota does not have voter registration. 9Oregon is a vot ebymail state and does not have traditional early voting or traditional polling places. 10 Pennsylvania reported that the state cannot s ystem atically track data on poll workers. 11 Puerto Rico reported that data on poll workers are not available and that poll workers were v olun teers, not PRSEC employees the abbreviation was not defined by the state . 12 Vermont did not provide data on the number of poll workers. Pr ior to this report being finalized, Vermont provided updated statewide totals for most items in F1 but was unable to provide jurisdiction  level data that could be incorporated into the EAVS. The statewide vote totals are T otal number of voters who cast a ballot that was counted  F1a 371,452 Voters who cast a ballot at a physical polling place on Election Day and whose ballots were counted F1b 91,079 UOCAVA voters who cast a ballot via an absentee ballot or FWAB and whose ballots were counted F1c 2,719 Voters who cast a mailed ballot and whose ballots were counted F1d 225,621 Voters who cast a ballot at an in person early voting location and whose ballots were counted F1f 2,033 13 Before t his reports finalization, Virginia notified the EAC that the state wide number of early voting polling places in D4a was 208, not 133. 14 Washington is a vote bym ail s tate. Voters can register and vote on or before Election Day. The total in F1g voters who cast a mailed ballot in a jurisdiction that conducts elections entirely by mail and whose ballots were counted include s inperson voters that were issued a mailed ballot packet at a voting center32  Overview of Election Administration and Voting that they could deposit into a ballot drop box or mail. Totals in F1f voters who cast a ballot at an in person early voting location and whose ballots were counted include voters who used a disability access unit. 15 The number of jurisdictions in Wisconsin c han ged several times over the two year pe riod covered by the 2020 EAVS due to incorporations, mergers, and similar mechanisms. Wisconsin canvass data tracks individual contests , and therefore, the total ballots cast in any election is highly unlikely to match the total votes cast in any one conte st. Wisconsin voters are not required to vote in each contest on the ballot and undervotes are the likely cause of total ballots cast data being higher than the number of votes in a contest.Overview of

Overvie w Table 2 Data Notes  General Notes Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating national percentages. The percentage calculations at the national level U.S. Total only used data from those states that provided data for the numerator and denominator of the calculation. Because each percentage was calculated independently, the percentages of mail ed ballots counted and rejected may not sum to 100 for some states or at the national level. The Total Mail Voters column reflects the number of voters who cast a ballot by mail that was counted. It does not include voters who cast a UOCAVA ballot or FWAB.Overview of Election Administration and Voting  37 The Total Mailed Ballots Transmitted column captures the total number of mailed ballots that states reported transmitting, regardless of whether the ballot was returned or not. The number ofballots transmitted typically exceeds the number of ballots retur ned because some voters who transmitted a mailed ballot choose to vote by another mode or to not vote at all. Total MailedBallots Returned typically exceeds Total Mail Voters because some returned mailed ballots arerejected for not meeting state requirements. Mailed Ballots Counted may not match Total Mail Voters because states may have different methodologies for calculating these numbers. The Total Mailed Ballots Returned column includes both counted and rejected ballots that were returned to election o ffices. 1Alabama repor ted m ail and early in person voting data together as the Total Mail Voters 300,684. Both are considered absentee voting  thus, the data for transmission method are commingled and cannot be reported separately. 2Data on r ejected m aile d ballots for Georgia include rejected ballots entered by counties into the state voter registration system as of February 202 1, which does not necessarily include all ballots rejected by counties. 3Butte County and Valley County in Idaho responded Data not available to the number of mail ed ba llo ts received C1b but reported data for the number of mail ed ballots counted C3a. Madison County and Valley County in Idaho reported more mailed ballots counted than mailed ballots received. Because of these responses, the total number of mail ed ballots counted exceeds the number of mail ed ballots received at the state level for Idaho, and the percentage of returned ballots that were counted exceeds 100. 4Kansas did not provide any survey comments to explain why the data reported in the Total Mail Voters co lumn exceeds that of the Total Mailed Ballots Transmitted column, nor why the percentage of mailed ballots counted and rejected does not sum to 100. Some jurisdictions that reported data on Total Mail Voters did not provide data for Total Mailed Ballots Transmitted. 5The Northern Mariana Islands did not provide any survey comments to explain why the data reported in th e T otal Mail Voters column exceeds that of the Total Mailed Ballots Transmitted column, nor why the percentages of mailed ballots counted and rejected does not sum to 100. 6Puerto Rico reported data not available in question C4. In add ition, this territory noted in a survey comment that the Total Mail Voters column may include ballots for non federal elections and that its response in the Total Mail Voters and  Turnout by Mail columns includes  voters who cast  their vote early but in their home, not in a polling location . 7Local election officials in Wisconsin were still recording voter participation method at the time data was pr ovi ded for this report therefore, the Total Mail Voters data were incomplete. These data are currently available from the state.38  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Overview Table 3  InPerson Voting and Other Modes of Voting State InPerson Election Day Voters InPerson Early Voters Provisional Voters Total  Total  Total  Alabama 1 2,014,242 86.5   8,840 0.4 Alaska 2 157,220 43.5 82,451 22.8 11,509 3.2 American Samoa 10,310 86.3 455 3.8 12 0.1 Arizona 371,565 10.9 69,063 2.0 30,151 0.9 Arkansas 3 258,836 21.4 830,561 68.6 5,082 0.4 California 4 1,124,389 6.3 966,201 5.5 216,781 1.2 Colorado 89,789 2.7 108,856 3.3 150 0.0 Connecticut 1 1,188,283 63.8   104 0.0 Delaware 345,809 67.2 5,236 1.0 107 0.0 District of Columbia 29,036 8.4 80,959 23.4 1,738 0.5 Florid a 5 1,942,102 17.4 4,332,912 38.9 7,169 0.1 Georgia 980,627 19.5 2,704,002 53.8 9,347 0.2 Guam 16,167 55.0 12,966 44.1 71 0.2 Hawaii 4,522 0.8 24,214 4.2 6 0.0 Idaho 6 384,319 43.7 145,388 16.5 0 0.0 Illinois 2,049,927 33.4 2,005,711 32.7 42,003 0.7 Indiana 1,201,154 38.7 1,354,897 43.7 1,348 0.0 Iowa 1 698,557 41.1   1,293 0.1 Kansas 505,132 36.6 375,196 27.2 36,107 2.6 Kentucky 477,612 22.2 1,024,965 47.7 77 0.0 Louisiana 1,182,672 54.5 817,951 37.7 658 0.0 Maine 311,560 37.9 151,535 18.4 108 0.0 Maryland 439,094 14.4 987,373 32.3 108,478 3.5 Massachusetts 7 1,256,443 34.3 852,926 23.3 1,724 0.0 Michigan 8 2,286,764 41.0 529,015 9.5 77 0.0 Minnesota 6 1,380,309 42.0 607,304 18.5   Mississippi 1 1,085,337 81.4   11,358 0.9 Missouri 1 2,288,607 71.5   2,139 0.1 Montana 1 9,497 1.6   364 0.1 Nebraska 417,349 43.2 51,537 5.3 9,998 1.0 Nevada 128,729 9.1 540,767 38.4 66,359 4.7 New Hampshire 1, 6 554,315 68.1     New Jersey 9 987 0.0   293,894 6.5 New Mexico 10 142,470 15.3 456,280 49.2 687 0.1 New York 4,284,263 49.2 2,502,161 28.8 84,884 1.0 North Carolina 11 896,818 16.2 3,460,562 62.4 16,388 0.3 North Dakota 6 91,803 25.2 87,882 24.1   Overview of Election Administration and Voting  39 State InPerson Election Day Voters InPerson Early Voters Provisional Voters Total  Total  Total  Northern Mariana Islands 3,970 29.7 8,130 60.9 24 0.2 Ohio 2,344,886 39.3 1,345,715 22.5 126,066 2.1 Oklahoma 1,114,001 71.2 167,516 10.7 1,986 0.1 Oregon 12     45 0.0 Pennsylvania 13 4,214,277 60.4   106,951 1.5 Puerto Rico 1,092,637 84.3 48,724 3.8 8,977 0.7 Rhode Island 1, 14 198,611 38.2   2,488 0.5 South Carolina 1,182,726 46.9 894,078 35.4 5,442 0.2 South Dakota 208,396 48.8 93,469 21.9 65 0.0 Tennessee 766,552 24.9 2,071,168 67.4 6,222 0.2 Texas 1,707,821 14.9 8,660,809 75.6 37,760 0.3 U.S. Virgin Islands 8,119 44.9 8,173 45.2 94 0.5 Utah 81,970 5.3 35,048 2.3 31,652 2.1 Vermont 6 90,959 24.7 2,033 0.6   Virginia 1,657,228 36.9 1,798,050 40.1 15,825 0.4 Washington 15   183 0.0 43 0.0 West Virginia 396,926 49.5 256,113 31.9 4,222 0.5 Wisconsin 16 1,337,269 40.4 651,791 19.7 57 0.0 Wyoming 135,426 48.6 55,903 20.1 15 0.0 U.S. Total 47,148,389 30.5 41,266,229 30.6 1,316,945 0.8 40  Overview of Election Administration and Voting State UOCAVA Voters Other Voters Total  Total  Alabama 1 5,281 0.2   Alaska 2 13,519 3.7 4,230 1.2 American Samoa 214 1.8   Arizona 18,527 0.5   Arkansas 3 30,512 2.5 174 0.0 California 4 93,452 0.5 923,698 5.2 Colorado 28,908 0.9   Connecticut 1 7,689 0.4   Delaware 2,369 0.5   District of Columbia 5,299 1.5   Florida 5 116,364 1.0 184,533 1.7 Georgia 18,475 0.4   Guam 65 0.2   Hawaii 2,720 0.5   Idaho 6 3,184 0.4   Illinois 24,297 0.4   Indiana 9,943 0.3   Iowa 1 5,980 0.4   Kansas 5,434 0.4   Kentucky 4,664 0.2   Louisiana 5,919 0.3   Maine 5,771 0.7   Maryland 21,806 0.7   Massachusetts 7 25,331 0.7 529 0.0 Michigan 8 21,793 0.4   Minnesota 6 15,740 0.5   Mississippi 1 2,960 0.2   Missouri 1 11,017 0.3   Montana 1 4,368 0.7   Nebraska 2,707 0.3   Nevada 7,445 0.5   New Hampshire 1, 6 6,252 0.8   New Jersey 9 20,903 0.5   New Mexico 10 5,132 0.6 284 0.0 New York 66,993 0.8   North Carolina 11 26,386 0.5 168,900 3.0 North Dakota 6 1,653 0.5   Northern Mariana Islands 0 0.0   Overview of Election Administration and Voting  41 State UOCAVA Voters Other Voters Total  Total  Ohio 21,854 0.4   Oklahoma 6,366 0.4   Oregon 12 16,534 0.7   Pennsylvania 13 28,014 0.4 842 0.0 Puerto Rico 587 0.0   Rhode Island 1, 14      South Carolina 12,906 0.5   South Dakota 2,951 0.7   Tennessee 14,676 0.5   Texas 60,292 0.5   U.S. Virgin Islands 8 0.0   Utah 7,474 0.5   Vermont 6 2,986 0.8   Virginia 32,328 0.7   Washington 15  64,848 1.6   West Virginia 2,215 0.3   Wisconsin 16  13,481 0.4 7,387 0.2 Wyoming 1,705 0.6   U.S. Total 938,297 0.6 1,290,577 2.5 Overview Table 3 Calculation Notes  InPerson Election Day Voters, Total uses question F1b.

The percentage calculations at the national level U.S. Total only used data from those states that provided data for the numerator and denominator of the calculation. Question F1f includes all voters who participated in the election in person prior to Election Day. This includes in person early voting, in person absentee voting, and any other terminology the state used to refer to in person early voting as reported in question Q24 of the 2020 Policy Survey.42  Overview of Election Administration and Voting Question F1h was not mandatory. States only reported data in this item if they offered another mode of voting aside from those listed in questions F1b F1g or if there were counted ballots that could not be categorized in questions F1b F1g. Because each percen tage was calculated independently, the percentages of turnout by mode in this table and the previous table may not sum to 100 for some states or at the national level. 1Alabama, Connecticut, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island did not report data in F1f , because the number of in person early voters could not be tracked separately from other modes of participation. 2Alaskas F1h data included ballots transmitted by electronic transmission online or fax delivery. 3Arkansass F1h data include d nu rsi ng home patients who refused their ballots and votes by bearer, admin,  or delivered by another person. 4Californias F1h data includ ed conditio n al v oter registration CVR voters, SDR voters , manual voter history updates, confidentials, mailed ballots from domestic and UOCAVA voters that could not be separated by mode, and other counted ballots not reported in other F1 items. 5Two counties in Flo r ida Duval and Indian River counties combined their reported number of UOCAVA and domestic mailed ballots in F1h in lieu of reporting them separately within F1c and F1d , respectively. 6Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Vermont are exempt from the NVRA r eq uir ement to offer provisional ballots. North Dakota is exempt from offering provisional ballots because it does not require voter registration. 7Massachusettss F1h data include d nonU OCAV A AV absentee voting ballots not returned by mail. 8Michigans data in the In Person E ar ly V oters columns r eflect those who voted absentee at the local clerks office prior to Election Day. 9New Jersey did not report data in F1f because the state did not offer in person early voting. 10 New Mexicos F1h data include d bal lot s cast because of emergency medical reasons. 11 North Carolinas F1h data include d cur bsi de absentee voters . 12 Oregon is a vote bymail s t ate an d traditional early voting does not exist. 13 Pennsylvania reported that the state cannot systematically track data on poll workers . Pennsyl v ania s F1h data include d ballots for which vote method not identified in the system. 14 Rhode Island reported that data for question F1c is unavailab le. 1 5Washington is a vote bymail stat e .

Overv iew Tabl e 4 Data Notes General Notes Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating national percentages. The percentage calculations at the national level U.S. Total only used data from those states that provided data for the numerator a nd denominator of the calculation.Overview of Election Administration and Voting  47 Because percentages for each age category were calculated independently, the percentages for each age category may not sum to 100 for some states or at the national level. In calculating percentages for poll worker age categories, the sum of questions D7b D7g was used instead of D7a because some states did not report data in all age categories. 1Alabama, Connecticut, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, and New H ampshire did not report complete data on early voting because some of this data could not be tracked separately from Election Day voting data. 2Alaska, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, N orth Dakota, the Northern Mariana Islands, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Vermont do not track data on the ages of their poll workers . 3Colorado did not distinguish between early voting and E lec tion Day voting in collecting information on poll workers. Because Colorado counti es automatically mail ballots to every active voter and most voters choose to vote the mail ballot, a large number of poll workers are needed to process the mail ballots. That work begins in the early voting period and continues through Election Day and th e eight day post election period when military and overseas voters can return their ballot and voters with signature or ID issues can cure their ballots . 4Connecticut provided data on the total number of poll workers in question D7a but was unable to pr ovide the age breakdown in questions D7b D7g. 5In Hawaii, i np er son voting locations are called Voter Service Centers and provide accessible in person voting, SDR, and collection of voted ballots. 6Kansas did not report data on the number of pollin g pl aces in questions D3 and D4. 7Louisiana reported both its early voting and Election Day poll workers in question D5. 8Maine reported that data on the number of early voting poll workers in question D6 was not available. 9The number of Elect ion Day voting locations in Maryland for the 2020 g eneral election was greatly reduced due to the COVID 19 pandemic and the lack of poll workers. The 320 Election Day voting locations reported in D3a all served as county wide vote centers. In a typical election, the number of Election Day polling places generally corresponds to the numbers of precincts, and each polling place only serves the precincts assigned to it. 10 Massachusetts reported that  Th ose who worked early voting were not called poll workers and varied each day of early voting. 11 Michigan reported data in D4 and noted that early voting takes place at a c le rks office or their satellite offices for in person absentee voting only. All Michigan jurisdictions reported zero for the number of early voting poll workers in D6 regular office staff operated clerks offices and satellite locations . 12 New Jersey did not report data in questions D4a nor D 6 because the state did not offer in person early voting. 13 Precinct, polling plac e, and early voting site counts are based on data that election officials entered into North Carolinas Statewide Election Information Management System SEIMS and may be marginallydifferent than the number of sites that were actually open during early voting and Election Day voting . 14 North Dakota provided data on the total number of poll workers in question D7a but was unable to pr ovide the totals for Election Day and early voting poll workers in questions D5 and D6 or the age breakdown in questions D7b D7g. 15 Ohio reported zero early voting poll workers with a comment that regular office staff operated the ear ly v oting sites. 16 Oregon is a vote bymai l state and does not have or track traditional poll workers for in person voting. 17 Pennsylvania pr ov ides in person absentee and mail in voting at county election offices and satellite county election offices. Absentee and mail in ballots cast in person are secured until E lection Day to be tabulated by the county board of elections. Pennsylvania reported that the state cannot systematically track data on poll workers.48  Overview of Election Administration and Voting 18 Puerto Rico reported that data on poll workers are not available and that poll workers were vo lun teers, not PRSEC employees. 19 South Carolina only reported poll workers who were under the age of 18 and did not provide data for any o th er age categories . South Carolinas data on poll worker ages has been excluded from this table. 20 Vermont did not provide data on the number of poll workers. 21 Virginia does not capture or track information on the age of poll workers . Bef ore this reports finalization, Virginia notified the EAC that the statewide number of early voting polling places in D4a was 208, not 133. 22 Washington is a vote bymai l s tate and does not have traditional polling place s. Washington has voting centers that are open for the entire voting period, not just a single day. Each county is required to have two certified election administrators and can hire election workers to assist with processing returned ballots. 23 Wisconsin state statute does not require the state to track data on early voting physical polling loc atio ns and poll workers. Partial data are available through the state.Overview of Election Administration and Voting  49 Overview Table 5  Election Technology and Voting Methods State Total Number of Voting Machines Deployed DRE without VVPAT DRE with VVPAT Total  Total  Alabama 4,864     Alaska 758   152 20.1 American Samo a 1      Arizona 1,539   19 1.2 Arkansas 4,480 76 1.7 92 2.1 California 33,163   23 0.1 Colorado 1,851     Connecticut 2,154     Delaware 1,057   1,050 99.3 District of Columbia 694     Florida 14,015   67 0.5 Georgia 30,824     Guam 11     Hawaii 292   276 94.5 Idaho 1,506   72 4.8 Illinois 20,043   2,215 11.1 Indiana 14,868 5,775 38.8 956 6.4 Iowa 2,874     Kansa s 2 5,871 43 0.7 4,700 80.1 Kentucky 4,246 528 12.4 570 13.4 Louisiana 9,828 9,747 99.2   Maine 3 1,088     Maryland 3,651     Massachusetts 4,386     Michigan 8,118     Minnesota 5,710     Mississippi 7,048 5,820 82.6 20 0.3 Missouri 5,346   330 6.2 Montana 248     Nebraska 1,422     Nevada 5,765   5,646 97.9 New Hampshire 652     New Jersey 2,207 1,495 67.7 632 28.6 New Mexico 1,461     New York 18,792     North Carolina 9,468     North Dakota 524     50  Overview of Election Administration and Voting State Total Number of Voting Machines Deployed DRE without VVPAT DRE with VVPAT Total  Total  Northern Mariana Island s 4 4     Ohio 25,164   7,028 27.9 Oklahoma 2,263     Orego n 5      Pennsylvania 24,413     Puerto Rico 6,075     Rhode Island 612     South Carolina 16,873     South Dakota 630     Tennessee 9,199 5,483 59.6   Texas 42,151 20,978 49.8 2,211 5.2 U.S. Virgin Islands 80     Utah 41     Vermon t 6 530     Virgini a 7 4,057     Washington 186     West Virginia 5,401   1,887 34.9 Wisconsi n 8      Wyoming 863     U.S. Total 369,366 49,945 13.5 27,946 7.6 Overview of Election Administration and Voting  51 State Ballot Marking Devices Scanners Hand Counting Total Jurisdictions Total  Total  Alabama 2,044 42.0 2,820 58.0 0 Alaska 289 38.1 317 41.8 1 American Samo a 1     1 Arizona 1,093 71.0 427 27.7 1 Arkansas 3,373 75.3 939 21.0 5 California 31,770 95.8 1,370 4.1 0 Colorado 1,668 90.1 183 9.9 1 Connecticut   2,154 100.0 0 Delaware   7 0.7 3 District of Columbia 562 81.0 132 19.0 0 Florida 4,723 33.7 9,225 65.8 0 Georgia 27,078 87.8 3,746 12.2 0 Guam 8 72.7 3 27.3 0 Hawaii   16 5.5 0 Idaho 881 58.5 553 36.7 12 Illinois 9,313 46.5 8,515 42.5 0 Indiana 4,807 32.3 3,330 22.4 0 Iowa 1,402 48.8 1,472 51.2 0 Kansa s 2   1,128 19.2  Kentucky 564 13.3 2,584 60.9 3 Louisiana   81 0.8 0 Maine 3 496 45.6 592 54.4 187 Maryland 1,729 47.4 1,922 52.6 0 Massachusetts 2,173 49.5 2,213 50.5 58 Michigan 3,367 41.5 4,751 58.5 0 Minnesota 2,794 48.9 2,916 51.1 2 Mississippi 507 7.2 701 9.9 0 Missouri 2,402 44.9 2,614 48.9 1 Montana 136 54.8 112 45.2 10 Nebraska 1,265 89.0 157 11.0 0 Nevada 80 1.4 39 0.7 0 New Hampshire 310 47.5 342 52.5 123 New Jersey   80 3.6 0 New Mexico   1,461 100.0 33 New York 7,768 41.3 11,024 58.7 62 North Carolina 6,001 63.4 3,467 36.6 0 North Dakota 260 49.6 264 50.4 0 Northern Mariana Island s 4   4 100.0 0 52  Overview of Election Administration and Voting State Ballot Marking Devices Scanners Hand Counting Total Jurisdictions Total  Total  Ohio 12,510 49.7 5,626 22.4 0 Oklahoma   2,263 100.0 0 Orego n 5     0 Pennsylvania 10,860 44.5 13,553 55.5 0 Puerto Rico   6,075 100.0 1 Rhode Island 78 12.7 534 87.3 0 South Carolina 14,129 83.7 2,744 16.3 0 South Dakota 533 84.6 97 15.4 0 Tennessee 2,205 24.0 1,511 16.4 11 Texas 15,250 36.2 3,712 8.8 15 U.S. Virgin Islands 50 62.5 30 37.5 0 Utah 29 70.7 12 29.3 0 Vermon t 6 312 58.9 218 41.1 101 Virgini a 7   4,057 100.0 0 Washington 108 58.1 78 41.9 0 West Virginia 2,743 50.8 771 14.3 0 Wisconsi n 8     705 Wyoming 496 57.5 367 42.5 0 U.S. Total 178,166 48.2 113,309 30.7 1,336 Overview Table 5 Calculation Notes  Total Number of Voting Machines Deployed uses the sum of questions F5c1, F5c2, F5c3, F6c1, F6c2, F6c3, F7c1, F7c2, F7c3, F8c1, F8c2, F8c3, F9c1, F9c2, F9c3, F10c1, F10c2 , and F10c3.

Overview of Election Administration and Voting  53 Overview Table 5 Data Notes  General Notes Although other descriptive tables in this chapter used casewise deletion at the state level in calculating percentages, this table did not . When a state reported not using a type of equipment, the number of devices of that type was filled with zero to better capture at the national level the quantity and percentage that each voting technology accounted for in the 2020 general election. 1American Samoa reported only hand counting ballots in the 2020 general election . 2Kansas did not respond to question F7a on the use of BMDs or question F11a on the use of hand counting . 3The data depicted in this table for Maine und erreported the number o f BMDs accessible voting solution deployed by the states jurisdictions. Each voting place was provided with at least one BMD, and some larger jurisdictions used multiple devices. In the data previously provided to the EAC, Maine reported that each jurisdiction used only one device. The actual number of devices deployed statewi de was 527. 4The Northern Mariana Islands reported using BMDs in question F7a and provided a description of pen c ils. 5Oregon reported in question F8a that each of its jurisdictions use d sca nners, but for the purposes of this report, data on the number of scanners deployed was not tracked. 6Vermont provided a response of valid skip for all jurisdictions in question F6a and provided a resp onse of does not apply for 41.1 of its jurisdictions in question F8a. 7Virginia reported using BMDs in all 133 of its jurisdictions, but initially did not report jurisdiction level data on the number of BMDs deployed. Before this reports finalization, Virginia notified the EAC that the statewide number of BMDs in F7c1, F7c2, and F7c3 was 2,533 . 8Wisconsin doe s not permit the use of DRE s without a VVPAT. Wisconsin also does not permit the use of punch card machines or lever machines. The state tracks the machine types employed in each jurisdiction and not the number of machines deployed in each ju risdiction.54  Election Law and Procedure Chapter 2. Election Law and Procedure The Policy Survey Key Findings The 2020 Election Administration Policy Survey Policy Survey aske d states to identify the election laws and procedures that govern voter registration, election technology, voter eligibility, modes of voting, and election audits in their state. Notable findings from this survey include In 2020, more states reported provi ding Election Administration and Voting Survey  EAVS responses at the state level for every EAVS section compared to 2018. Fourteen states reported conducting all mail elections for the 2020 general election, either statewide or in certain jurisdictions. This is double the number of states from the 2018 PolicySurvey , but in some cases , allmail voting was implemented in response to the COVID 19 pandemic, and it was not a permanent change. More states reported having an online voter registration system in the 2020 Policy Survey 45 states  compared to in the 2018 Policy Survey 40 states . In the majority of cases, individuals can use this system to register to vote and to update their registration. About half of the states reported allowing nonmilitary vo ters residing in the United States to receive their ballots through an electronic format, such as email, fax, through an online voter registration portal, or through a mobile phone app, under certain circumstances. Roughly half of the states reported allowing permanent absentee status when a Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act UOCAVA  voter registration is submitted via a Federal Post Car d Application  FPCA , a decrease from 2018. Forty four states reported requir ing a post election ta bulation audit that verifies that voting equipment used during an election properly counts a sample of voted ballots after an election. Introduction Although quantitative data from state1 and local election officials provide an important window into how the 20 20 general election w as run, these data must be understood in the context of state laws and policies. In 2008, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission EAC introduced a component of the EAVS that collects information on state election laws . Since 2018, this data has been collected through the Policy Survey , which uses closed ended questions to capture states broad policies. It is important to remember that state election laws are nua nced, and this report simplifies them for the purpose of providing an overview of election policies that offe rs important context to understanding the EAVS data. This report provides an overview and summary of the Policy Surveys findings. 1 Throughout this report, unless otherwise specified, the term state can be understood to apply to the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia , and five U.S. territories American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that submit Policy Survey and EAVS data. Election Law and Procedure  55 Additional information about state responses is available in Appendix A of this chapter. The 2020 Policy Survey included updates to some of the 2018 items to better capture state policy nuances. The 2020 Policy Survey collected data on states election laws, policies, and practices that would be in place for the November 2020 general election. Most states submitted this information before the election. The Policy Survey was also used to validate 2020 EAVS data prior to states certifying their data as final. The goal of the 2020 Policy Survey was to create comparisons between states across broad policy categories and to provide context in understanding the EAVS data submitted by s tates. Because of the nature of the closed ended survey questions, some of the nuances in state election policies could not be accounted for. States were encouraged to forward additional information and context behind their Policy Survey responses to allow their data to be interpreted as accurately as possible. For further information about how the Policy Survey data were collected and used to validate EAVS data , please see Chapter 5 of this report. Responding to the 2020 EAVS The 2020 Policy Survey asked states to describe who provides the data to respond to the questions in each section of the EAVS the state election office, local election offices, or both the state and local offices. Some states indicated that all sections are completed by the state elec tion office, and some gather data for all sections from their local jurisdictions.2 Many states answered certain sections at the state level and other sections at the jurisdiction level. With the exception of sections A and F of the EAVS, roughly half of the states provided responses at the state level, whereas about one fifth of states reported that responses are provided by local officials. For sections A and F, about 60 of states reported providing responses at the state level, and slightly less than 15 of states reported providing responses at the local level.3 Roughly one  quarter to one third of the responses for each section were provided by both state and local officials. In 2020, more states reported providing EAVS responses at the state level for every EAVS section compared to in 2018 see Table 1 . The findings from this question illustrate the complexities that state and local election officials experience when answering the EAVS. Many stat es with a large number of jurisdictions reported 2 What constitutes a jurisdiction for EAVS reporting is defined by how each state chose to provide data . For the 2020 EAVS, most states repor ted data on the county level or county equivalent, such as parishes for Louisiana. Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, and Virginia reported data for independent cities in addition to counties. The te rritories, the District of Columbia, and Alaska each repor ted as a single jurisdiction. Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin repor ted data on the township level. Maine also repor ted its UOCAVA data in Section B as a separate jurisdiction , because this information was only collected at the state level. Michigan reported data for the county level, but most election administration activities take place in the 1,520 local election jurisdictions in the state . 3 Information on how states answer Section A of the EAVS was collected in item Q31 of the Policy Survey. Information on how states answer Section B of the EAVS was collected in Q32. Information on how states answer Section C of the EAVS was collected in Q33. Information on how states answer Section D of the EAVS was collected in Q34. Information on how states answer Section E of the EAVS was collected in Q35. In formation on how states answer the Section F of EAVS was collected in Q36. 56  Election Law and Procedure providing EAVS data entirely at the local level. Furthermore, some states reported providing EAVS data for some sections at the state level while relying on local officials for other sections. Table 1.

In almost all states, the chief state election official is responsible for certifying the states EAVS data submission andor receiving and certifying the spending of Help America Vote Act  HAVA funds on behalf of the state. In 2020, 75 of states reported that the chief election official selects the state representative for and supervises local election officials selection as representatives to the EAC Standards Board. The Standards Board consists of 55 state and 55 local election officials who assist the EAC in carrying out its mandates. 5 Policies on Voter Registration and List Maintenance The primary federal law governing voter registration in the United States is the National Voter Registration Act NVRA, which became effective after the 1994 g eneral election. 6 The NV RA expands voter registration opportunities for voters by creating more standardized registration processes and by designating more places as voter registration agencies . It also requires that states conduct a uniform and nondiscriminatory general program to remove from their lists the records of individuals who are no longer eligible to vote. Congress also passed HAVA in 2002, requiring states to adopt a computerized statewide voter registration list. 7 States use these registration lists to determine who is eligible to participate in elections. States also face the challenge of keeping these lists up to date, as voters commonly move 4 Minnesota did not provide a response to Section E of this item for the 2020 Policy Survey . 5 Information on the EAC related duties of chief state election officials was collected in item Q1a of the Policy Survey. Eleven states provided additional information for cases in which another official performs these functions. The District of Columbia noted that it does not have any local election officials. 6 Several states are not cover ed by the NVRA. North Dakota is exempt because it does not have voter registration. U.S. territories are also not subject to the NVRA, and the states of Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyoming are exempt because they had same day registration SDR in 1994 and have continued to make this option available uninterrupted since that time. 7 52 U.S.C.  21083. Election Law and Procedure  57 to different jurisdictions or states, die , or become otherwise ineligible to vote. North Dakota is the only state that does n ot require voter registration. Between 2018 and 2020, some states passed laws allowing individuals to register to vote online, register in person on Election Day, or register through an automated process. In 2020, states reported receiving a record number of registration applications. Further information on state registration data is included in Chapter 3 of this report. Database Systems States responded to the HAVA voter registration requirements in different ways. Some states adopted a single, central platform at the state level that connect s to terminals in local jurisdictions. This type of system is typically referred to as a top down voter registration system. Other states implemented a state voter registration database that gathers and aggregates information from their local jurisdictions voter registration databases. This type of system is typically referred to as a bottom  up system. 8 If a system has a mix of top down and bottom up characteristics, then it is referred to as a hybrid system. The specific characteristics of hybrid systems vary state by state . The Policy Survey asks states to report the type of voter registration database they have and how often information is shared between states and local jurisdictions. 9 Figure 1 shows that a majority of states 67.9 reported having voter registration databases that function in a top down manner. About 20 of states reported having a bottom up registration system that uploads jurisdiction level information at regular interv als to form the statewide voter registration list, and only 10.7 of states reported having a hybrid system that combines elements of both.10 In practice, these state registration system categories can be fluid. Some top down registration systems may imple ment processes of the bottom up registration system and vice versa. States that report ed having either a bottom up or hybrid system were asked to report how often their jurisdictions transmit voter registration information to the statewide database.11 For these two systems, realtime data transmissions were most common reported in 58.8 of the states with bottom up or hybrid systems, whereas 23.5 of the states reported that voter registration information is transmitted daily.12 Texas reported that inform ation is transmitted both ways transmissions from online counties happen in real time, whereas in offline counties, it happens 8 For a bottom up voter registration system to be considered a statewide system, the state database, the data, and the data flow must be defined, maintained, and administered by the state.

The Northern Mariana Islands reported that information is retrieved upon request. Data Linkages Election officials must accomplish two primary activities related to voter registration adding individuals to the database who are eligible to vote and maintaining the accuracy of the database .14 A state accomplishes these goals by accessing or linking to other databases to verify the voter 13 The 2016 Statutory Overview found that several Texas jurisdictions use the Texas s tatewide voter registration database to directly manage registration data, and other Texas jurisdictions manage their own voter registration data using a third  party vendor. Texas refers to these as online and offline jurisdictions. Although online counties transmit information in real time through an online voter registration system, offline jurisdictions transmit information in batches through a web browser application. 14 National Research Council . 2010.

Election Law and Procedure  59 registration information in its database. The NVRA also outlines steps that states are required to take to keep voter registration information current and to remove ineligible voters and d uplicate registrations from the voter lists. This task requires comparing voter lists to records in other databases to prevent duplicate registration records and to avoid adding individuals who are ineligible to register. 15 As th e National Academy of Sciences  NAS notes, HAVA requires the chief election official in each state to attempt to verify the information for first time voter registration applications against drivers license numbers in that states motor vehicle licensing agencys database or against the Social Security Administrations database of social security numbers. If no match is found, election officials in most states attempt to contact the applicant for additional information, but they manage this process in various ways. HAVA requir es that applicants who cannot be matched against one of these databases be allowed to vote on Election Day provided they present appropriate identification. 16 The Policy Survey asks states how they share information electronically with other state and fede ral government entities.17 These linkages are illustrated in Figure 2. Most states reported that they link their voter registration data with the agency that handles their states drivers licenses  85.7  and with entities that maintain the death records 80.4 . The other most commonly reported linkages were with entities that maintain felony or prison records, such as state courts and parole agencies 62.5. States that reported linking with the agency that handles drivers licenses most often reported transferring voter registration data daily  63.3, followed by in real time 18. 4 and by some other measure of time that is neither weekly nor monthly 10. 2. Of the states that reported linking with entities that maintain death records, the most common type of data transfer was monthly  58.7 , followed by weekly  21.7. States that reported linking registration data with entities that maintain felony records most often reported transferring data monthly  58.3 . 18 Less commo nly reported link ages included entities that maintain records of individuals who are declared mentally incompetent, state public assistance agencies, agencies for people with disabilities, other state agencies that are not required by the NVRA e.g., public libraries or lo cal government offices, federal agencies, and military recruiting offices. 15 Ibid. 16 52 U.S.C.  21083. 17 Although North Dakota does not have voter registration, the state does share information electronically with other government entities and is included in these analyses. 18 Information on which entities states link their voter registration databases with and how often data transfers occur was collected in item Q5 of the Policy Survey. 60  Election Law and Procedure Figure 2. States Most Commonly Link Voter Registration Databases W ith Government Agencies That Maintain Drivers Licenses and Death Records Source Information on the entities that are linked to state voter registration databases was collected in Q5 of the Policy Survey. This graph shows the number of states that reported linking their voter registration databases with the specified government agency. Automatic and Auto mated Voter Registration In 2020, 42.9 of states reported that voters may be registered to vote via an automated process, whether online or in person, during a transaction with a state government agency.19 Examples of these automated processes included those that force a choice, such as when an individual cannot proceed with a transaction without selecting whether or not they wish to be registered to vote, or processes that register a person to vote as a de fault, after which the individual may choose to opt out. In the event that an individual wishes to decline to register, the vast majority of states reported that they allow the declination to occur at the point of service. About onethird of states reported that they allow declinations via a mailer sent to the individual after the transaction.20 19 Information on auto matic and automated voter registration was collected in item Q6 of the Policy Survey . 20 Information on when an individual can decline to register to vote was collected in item Q6b of the Policy Survey. Election Law and Procedure  61 States that have some kind of automatic or automated voter registration process linked to a state agency transaction all reported that their state motor vehicle agency participates in this program , and about onequarter of the states indicated that public assistance agencies also participate. Less common program participants included agencies for people with disabilities and other designated state agencies . Florida a lso reported linking their voter registration process with tax collector offices and any office that issues state ID cards. Colorado reported linking with the states Department of Health Care Policy and Financing , and Alaska reported linking with the states Permanent Fund Dividend Division. Maryland noted the state agencies that participate in the automatic or automated voter registration program are designated by the Maryland General Assembly.21 Preregistration In the 2020 Policy Survey, most states 87.5 reported allowing individuals under the age of 18 to preregister to vote and become automatically registered once they turn 18 years old. Over ha lf of states that had a preregistration program reported that they allow individuals to preregister at age 17 51, whereas fewer states reported allowing individuals to preregister at age 16 38.8. Five states 10.2 indicated that they allow individuals to preregister at age 17 and a half. 22 Online Voter Registration Arizona became the first state to adopt online voter registration in 2002, and by 2016, the number of states that offered online voter registration jumped to 32. 23 Online voter registration generally mirrors the process of registering to vote using a paper form, but the information that is necessary to process the registration application is completed and submitted electronically, without the need of a paper form to be submitted or created . Forty five states 80.4, an increase from 72.7 in 2018 reported having an online voter registration portal in which individuals can register on their own, fully online, and without having to submit a paper form. In almost all of those states , individuals can both register to vote and update their registration via the system. Two states reported that individuals can only update their registration online and cannot use the online system to submit a new registration application. A majority of states with an online voter registration system 82.2 reported that only individuals with a valid drivers license or state issued ID card can use it. 24 Figure 3 shows the prevalence of online voter registration across states. 21 Information on which state agencies participate in automatic voter registration was collected in item Q6a of the Policy Survey . 22 Information on preregistration was collected in item Q10 of the Policy Survey. 23 EAVS Deep Dive Registering to Vote, httpswww.eac.govdocuments20170920eavs deep diveregistering to vote U.S. Election Assistance Commission. 2017 , September 20.

Information on whether a drivers license or state issued ID card is needed to register to vote online was collected in item Q7a of the Policy Survey. 62  Election Law and Procedure Figure 3. More Than Three Quarters of States Offer Online Registration S ource  Information on online registration polic y was collected in items Q7 and Q7a of the Policy Survey . States were also asked to describe the technological and user experience features of their online, webbased voter registration system and how voters use it. The most common feature was the use of a motor vehicle agency signature to register to vote 84.4, followed by mobile phone optimization 75.6 and sending a confirmation email to each registrant 60. Slightly less than half of all states reported having custom web page URLs to track where the voter came from to enter the online registration process e.g., a state agency or third party organization, providing a confirmation number to each registrant, and supporting languages other than English. About one quarter of states also reported the use of a third party application programming interface API, which allows different software components to communicate with each other. 25 Same Day Registration Instead of requiring voters to register in advance of an election, some states reported allowing individuals to register to vote and to cast a ballot on the same day. Roughly half of the states reported having same day registration SDR or a period of overlap between in person early voting and the close of voter registration in which a person can register to vote and cast a ballot on the 25 Information on the features of state online, web based voter registration systems was collected in item Q7b of the Policy Survey. Election Law and Procedure  63 same day  see Figure 4.26 Among states with SDR, it was most common to have SD R on Election Day 72.4. Additionally, the majority of states indicated that they allow SDR during in person early voting 69.27 Twel ve states reported having SDR during an overlap between the start of early voting and the close of voter registration. Some states noted that SDR only occurs in special cases, such as Alaska and Rhode Island for presidential elections. New residents wh o move to Nebraska after the close of voter registration can register to vote and can vote only for president in the general election former residents who move to another state after the close of registration can also vote only for president in the genera l election . In North Carolina, citizens who have become eligible to vote between the  close of books and Election Day may register on the same day as they vote.28 Figu re 4. Half of the States Offer Some Form of SameDay Voter Registration Sou rce Information on SDR policy was collected in items Q9 and Q9a of the Policy Survey. ED stands for Election Day. Other Cases includes instances in which states may allow for SDR during in person early voting only, during an overlap between the start of early voting and the close of voter registration, and other specific cases. 26 The timeline does not include an overlap between the mail balloting period and the close of voter registration. 27 Informat ion on state SDR policies was collected in item Q9 of the Policy Survey. Information on the circumstances of SDR was collected in item Q9a of the Policy Survey. 28 North Carolina did not provide clarification on what was meant by close of books. 64  Election Law and Procedure State Election Office Website The 2020 Policy Survey also asked states about which voter information search tools and other tools are available on each states election office website. A lmost all of the states indicated that voters can check their registration status and check their polling site location on the state election office website. Most states reported having tools that track b allot status, including UOCAVA ballots 87.5, mailed ballots  82.1 , and provisional ballots 51.8, and that check voter specific ballot information 76.8. Additionally, most states reported that their website allows voters to request to receive a mail or absentee ballot 67.9.29 List Maintenance The NVRA establishes a process for states to keep their voter registration lists accurate. Under this law, a registrant can be removed from a states list for the following reasons  The registrant requests to be removed  The registrant dies  The registrant is declared mentally incapacitated, if a state law requires it  The registrant is convicted of a specified crime, if state law requires it or  The registrant changes residences outside of the j urisdiction, in which case the removal process must be conducted in accordance with procedures set forth in the NVRA. 30 Under the process established by the NVRA, when a registrant appears to have moved outside of their jurisdiction due to returned or unde liverable mail, the state must follow a specific process to verify that the individual is no longer eligible to vote. An address confirmation procedure must be followed before removing the voter from the registration list. The 2020 Policy Survey asked states whether they differentiate between active and inactive voters in their voter registration records. Active voters are individuals who require no additional processing before they can vote, whereas inactive voters will require address verification before being permitted to vote. Fortysix states , three territories, and the District of Columbia indicated that they differentiate between the two types of voters, although according to state comments, the definitions for an active and inactive voter vary widely . 31 Guam, Idaho, North Dakota, New Hampshire, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Wyoming reported not distinguishing between active and inactive voters. Some states indicated using specific terminology Nebraska uses in NVRA to refer to inactive voters , Texas uses the term suspense voters, and American Samoa uses the term purged voter. West Virginia indicated that inactive voters are those flagged as moving and receiv ing a confirmation notice.  According to the 29 Information on state election office website lookup tools was collected in item Q8 of the Policy Survey. 30 52 U.S.C.  20507 31 Information on whether states differentiate between active and inactive voters was collected in item Q11 of the Policy Survey. Minnesota is NVRA exempt and does not define inactive voters as voters who remain eligible to vote but require address verification under the provisions of the National Voter Registration Act, as defined in the EAVS item A1c therefore, the EAVS item A1c does not apply to the state. Additionally, North Dakota does not have voter registration but does define inactive voters in the state voter file . Inactive voters are defined as those who have never voted before or have not voted in the last two federal elections. Although Wyoming does not keep an inactive list of eligible voters, the statewide voter registration system keeps a historical record of previously registered voters. Election Law and Procedure  65 NVRA, voters marked as inactive are still able to vote in elections unless they have not voted for two consecutive federal elections and have not updated their information. Almost three quarters  70  of states that reported differentiat ing between active and inactive voters also reported that they will move an active voter to the inactive voter list if mail that is sent by an election office to the voters residence is returned as undeliverable, whereas 62 of states reported that they will move an active voter to the inactive voter list if the voter fails to return a confirmation notice. Fifteen states commented with several additional actions , including change in address, not voting in a certain number of elections, determining a person is a felon, determining a person is deceased, and the existence of duplicate voter records.32 Figure 5. States That Differentiate Active and Inactive Voters Will Most Often Reactivate an Inactive Voter if the Voter Initiat es a Registration Update Source Information on p olicy regarding reactivating inactive voters was collected in Q11b of the Policy Survey. On the other hand, certain actions can result in moving an inactive voter to the active voter list. Figure 5 shows the reasons states report for reactivating inactive voters, if the state differentiates between active and inactive voters. Most states that distinguish between active and inactive voters 32 Information on moving an active voter to the inactive list was collected in item Q11a of the Pol icy Survey. 66  Election Law and Procedure Thi rtyfive states indicated that only local officials are responsible for modifying or removing voter registration records, and 12 states reported that modifying voter registration records is done by both state and local officials.34reported that they will move an inactive voter to the active voter list if an individual initiates an update to their registration record 96, returns a confirmation notice 88, votes in a federal election 78 for general and 76 for primary, votes in a state or local primary or general election both 76 respectively, andor requests a mail or UOCAVA ballot 68. Furthermore, roughly half of the states reported that they will move an inactive voter to the active voter list if there is an online confirmation of the voters registration record. Less common reasons for moving an inactive voter to the active voter list included if a voter signs a petition or completes a certificate of candidacy. Thirteen st ates indicated some other reason, including providing documentation e.g., appropriate identification or a signed affidavit at a polling place, submitting a new registration, and receiving an address change through the state motor vehicle agency . 33 Alaska, American Samoa, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Guam, South Carolina, and the U.S. Virgin Islands all indicated that they only modify records at the state level.35 Table 2 illustrates data sources used to identify potentially ineligible voters. Across states, the most common data sources were the state vital statistics office, reports from other states indicating a former resident registered to vote, a voter request for removal, entities that maintain prison records, and any mail not including ballots sent from an election office that was returned as undeliverable. 36 Most states reported sending confirmation notices to voters to help identify individuals who may be ineligible to vote, but the reasons for sending confirmation notices differ by state. Of the states that send confirmation notices , 41 85.4 reported sending confirmation notices pursuant to Section 8 d 1 B and Section 8 d 2 of the NVRA, 31 states 64.6 reported sending confirmation notices pursuant to a state statute, and seven states 14.6 reported sending confirmation notices pursuant to a formal administrative rule or guidance. Eight states reported that they do not send confirmation notices. 37 Sta tes most commonly reported sending confirmation notices to voters whose mail from an election office was returned as undeliverable 81.3, to voters whose addresses may have changed 72.9, to voters who have not voted in two consecutive gene ral elections 41.7, to voters who have been convicted of a disqualifying felony 35.4, and to voters who requested removal from the voter registration list 29.2. Less than one third of states reported sending confirmation notices to voters who have been declared mentally incompetent, voters who have obtained a drivers license in a new state, and voters who have not made contact with their state for a specified length of time. 33 Information on moving an inactive voter to the active list was collected in item Q11b of the Policy Survey. 34 The District of Columbia and American Samoa noted that they do not have local election officials Puerto Rico noted that state and l ocal officials have the same roles and responsibilities. 35 Information on who is responsible for modifying or removing voter registration records was collected in item Q12 of the Policy Survey. Nevada did not provide a response, and North Dakota indicated that this question does not apply because the state does not have voter registration. 36 Information on the data sources used to identify potentially ineligible voters was collected in item Q14 of the Policy Survey. 37 Information on whether and how states send confirmation notices to help identify ineligible voters was collected in item Q13 of the Policy Survey.

This question also collected information on whether states use commercial data sources, but no state selected that option. Five s tates 10.4 reported that all registered voters routinely receive a non forwardable notice during a specified increment of time this time frame ranges from one to four years. Just under 30 of states reported sending confirmation notices for some other reason.38 For example, some states or ce rtain jurisdictions within states indicated that they routinely send confirmation notices as part of their list maintenance procedures. States that are members of the Electronic Information Registration Center ERIC send confirmation notices to individuals who are eligible to vote but are 38 Information on which voters states send confirmation notices to was collected in item Q13a of the Policy Survey. 68  Election Law and Procedure unregistered. Other states indicated that notices are sent when there may be a change other than address e.g., name. Washington, a state in which nearly all voters cast their ballots by mail, reported that the mailing i nformation provided by a returned or forwarded ballot serves as the start of the confirmation process. Criminal Convictions and Voting The NVRA allows states to remove voters from their registration lists if the voter receives a disqualifying criminal conv iction or is incarcerated. The Policy Survey asks three questions about removing voters from registration lists due to disqualifying felony convictions and about the restoration of voting rights Which populations have their voting eligibility suspended due to a criminal conviction? For how long does a person with a felony conviction lose their right to vote? How can a person with a felony conviction become an eligible voter again? The District of Columbia, Guam, Maine, Puerto Rico, and Vermont reported that they do not limit a persons right to vote based on a criminal conviction. Conversely, 42 states reported that the conviction of any felony will limit a persons right to vote. About one fifth of states reported that they limit the voting rights of individuals convicted only of certain felonies, and nine states reported that they limit the voting rights of individuals who are convicted of other crimes that are not felonies e.g., election related crimes. 39 There is variation in the disqualification time periods and in the processes for restor ing voting rights. Of the states that have some form of felon disenfranchisement, most reported revoking the right to vote during the period of incarceration  90.4 andor any period of probation and parole  61.5. Some states also reported revoking voting rights during an additional length of time 19.2, such as a statutorily mandated waiting period andor until the payment of outstanding fines, restitution, or penalties  25. 40 The Policy Survey also asks states to indicate how disenfranchised individuals go about restoring their eligibility to vote. 41 Minnesota, Missouri, and the U.S. Virgin Islands reported automatically restoring the previous voter registration of persons with felony convictions once the period of disenfranchisement has passed, requiring no further action by the voter.42 Of the 49 states that indicated requiring some type of action, 79 .6 reported that a person is immediately eligible to vote and must reregister through the same process as the general public. Some states report ed having other conditions, such as presenting documentation during the registration process that shows that the person has completed the voter registration requirements 12.2 and having voting rights 39 Inform ation on state policies for suspending or revoking voting rights due to criminal convictions was collected in item Q37 of the Policy Survey. This item does not distinguish a felony conviction from the subsequent period of incarceration. 40 Information on the length of time a disqualifying felony conviction will restrict voting rights was collected in item Q37a of the Policy Survey. 41 Due to North Dakota not having voter registration, a person who is no longer incarcerated is automatically eligible to vote without any further action needed. In Delaware, felony convictions result in permanent disqualification from voting. 42 Guam law pro hibits incarcerated persons from voting. However, once the period of incarceration has ended, voting righ ts are restored. A non incarcerated felon is able to vote , and the individual is not removed from the voter registration roll . Election Law and Procedure  69 restored through a formal administrative process 16.3. Thirteen states provided survey comments that further explained their policies.43 In Louisiana, for example, if a person is under an order of imprisonment for a felony conviction but  has not been incarcerated pursuant to the order within the last five years , then that person is eligible to register. Florida and Iowa reported that the type of felony conviction determines the restoration of voting rights . Arizona indicated that for a first felony conviction, civil rights are automatically restor ed upon the completion of the sentence, parole, probation period, and payment of restitution  otherwise, voting rights must be restored through a formal process . Voting by Mail All states and territories and the District of Columbia offer their citizens the opportunit y to cast their ballots by mail in federal general elections.44 Some states use the term absentee voting to refer to mail voting . The 2020 Policy Survey demonstrates that there were wide variations among the states in which voters are eligible to vote by mail, what documentation voters must provide in order to receive a mailed ballot, how mailed ballots may be returned to election officials, and the deadlines for mail ed ballots to be postmarked and received by election offices for the 2020 general electio n. The COVID 19 restrictions pushed many states to expand their mail voting policies, and states reported more than double the number of mail ed ballots cast in the 2020 general election compared to the 2016 general election.45 In 2020, 39 states reported that they do not require voters to provide a reason for why they are requesting a mail ed ballot and for why they cannot vote in person on Electi on Day seven of those states reported requiring an excuse in 2018 but not in 2020. Conversely, one third of states reported requiring voters to provide an excuse, a decrease from 40 in the 2018 Policy Survey responses.46 Twenty six states reported that voters can request to be on a permanent absentee list from which they will automatically receive ballots for all future elections. Either any registrant can request to be a permanent absentee voter 21.4 of states or only individuals who meet specific criteria can request to be a permanent absentee voter 25 of states. 47 S tates have special criteria for individuals who make th e request to be granted permanent absentee status .48 The most common requirement was that the requester must have a disability 78.6 of states that have permanent absentee voting Delaware,49 Massachusetts, New York, Tennessee, and Wisconsin reported that they will also grant permanent absentee status to those who are infirm, 43 Information on state policies for restoring voting rights to persons with disqualifying felony convictions was collected in item Q37b of the Policy Survey. 44 Some states use the term in person absentee voting  to refer to the process by which a voter visits an election office to request a mail ed ballot, completes the ballot, and returns the ballot in one trip. However, EAVS considers this to be a form of inperson early voting and asks states to report their d ata as such. 45 For more information, see Chapter 1 of this report. 46 Information on whether states require an excuse for mail voting was collected in item Q17 of the Policy Survey. 47 Information on whether states have permanent absentee voting was collected in item Q19 of the Policy Survey. 48 Information on who can become a permanent absentee voter was collected in item Q19a of the Policy Survey. 49 Delaware also includes federal or state public service workers and their spouses or dependents, members of the uniformed services, and voters who are temporary residents. 70  Election Law and Procedure Figure 6. Number of States Offering Entirely Vote ByMail Elections Doubled From 2018 to 2020 Sou rce Information on the p olicy of allmail elections was collected in items Q9 and Q9a of the 2018 Policy Survey and in items Q18 and Q18a of the 2020 Policy Survey. Election Law and Procedure  71 have a permanent illness, or can provide a note from a medical professional. West Virginia indicated allowing address confidentiality program participants to be permanent absentee voters, and Louisiana indicated requiring individuals to be over a specified age. Despite conducting allmail elections, Oregon uses the term absentee voter for individuals who may be away from their residences when ballots are transmitted . With 2020s overall shift toward mail voting, the number of states that conducted all mail elections, in which all registered voters or all active registered voters are automatically sent a mail ed ballot, doubled since the 2018 Policy Survey. Figure 6 shows the 14 states that have some type of vote by mail system. Four states reported having some vote bymail jurisdictions. Ten states reported having statewide vote bymail systems, a significant increase from three states in 2018.50 The Policy Survey did not record whether the states that altered their all mail voting policy between the 2018 and the 2020 general elections did so temporarily or permanently or whether the change was made in direct response to the COVID 19 pandemic. It should be noted that although these states mailed registered voters a ballot, most states also provided in person voting options during early voting andor on Election Day. The Policy Survey also collected data on the circumstances under which voters could receive ballots through electronic means. This question applied specifically to nonmilitary voters residing in the United States , as voters who are members of the uniformed services or who are overseas citizens who wish to receive ballots electronically are covered under UOCAVA. Twenty nine states reported that they allow nonmilitary voters residing in the United States to receive their ballots through an electronic format, such as email, fax, through an online voter registration portal, or through a mobile phone app. Alaska, Guam, Kentucky, Maryland, Oregon, and Washington reported that voters may receive a ballot electronically for any circumstance.51 Other states reported having special circumstances.52 For example , 19 states indicated allowing voters with disabilities to receive ballots electronically, including seven states where voters must have specific disabilities and 12 states where voters may have any disability status.53 Massachusetts specified that the voter must have a disability that prevents them from marking a paper ballot independently and privately, and Maine noted that the voter must self identify as having a print disability. Hawaii, Nevada, and the U.S. Virgin Islands reported that they all ow electronic ballot transmission when a replacement ballot is need, and seven states reported that they allow electronic ballot transmission during emergency situations that hinder in person voting, such as a natural disaster. 54 50 Information on which states have an all votebymail system was collected in item Q18 of the Policy Survey. Information on whether the states all vote bymail system is used only in certain jurisdictions or is statewide was collected in item Q18a of the Policy Survey. California and Utah reported conducting all mail elections statewide in 2020 . In 2018, both states reported that only certain jurisdictions had all mail elections. 51 California did not report that voters may receive a ballot electronically under any circumstance but commented that any voter may cast a ballot using a certif ied, remote accessible vote bymail system regardless of disability status or whether they are an overseas or uniformed services voter. 52 Information on the circumstances under which voters may receive their ballots electronically was collected in item Q23 of the Policy Survey. 53 The U.S. Virgin Islands chose both of these response options. Delaware note d that disability status includes those who are ill or temporarily physically disabled. In Pennsylvania, voters may have any disability as defined by the Am ericans with Disabilities Act ADA. 54 Hawaii note d that a replacement ballot must be requested within five days of an election. 72  Election Law and Procedure New York and Mississippi e xtended their requirements to emergency responders , and in Mississippi, according to the state UOCAVA statute, emergency responders qualify for an electronic ballot if they are deployed outside of their county of residence during an emergency. Mailed Ballo t Tracking and Deadlines The 2020 Policy Survey asked states to report on their deadlines for mailed ballots from nonmilitary voters residing in the United States. Ballot deadlines for voters covered by UOCAVA were reported in separate questions, as UOCAVA ballot deadlines are typically different from those for other mailed ballots. The postmark deadlin e is Election Day for just under half 46.4 of states  however, Alabama, Iowa, North Dakota, Ohio, and Utah reported having a postmark deadline one day before Election Day.55 In 55.4 of states, mailed ballots must be received by Election Day, and in 42. 9 of states , mailed ballots must be received by a specified number of days after Election Day, with responses ranging from one to 20 days after Election Day.56 Louisiana reported that mailed ballots must be received by one day before Election Day.57 S tates also reported how long mailed ballots that arrive past the above deadlines are tracked for reporting in Section C of the EAVS.58 These mailed ballots are tracked indefinitely in 42.9 of states, or until canvassing is complete in 44.6 of states. Five states have a specific length of time for mailed ballot tracking four of these states reported a date between November 17, 2020 , and February 1, 2021.59 S tates vary in what satisfies postmark requirements for mail ed ballots.60 In states that require postmarks, the most commonly reported required feature was a physical postmark 76.7,61 followed by hand cancellation or a private express delivery service date stamp both 44.2 respectively and postal processing markings 41.9. Less commonly required features were intelligent barcodes 23.3 and a date on a voter affidavit 14. 62 Some states specified other ways of satisfying postmark requirements.63 Additionally, Ohio indicated accep ting an ID tag date , and Kansas indicated accep ting any other indicia from the U.S. Postal Service. In California, if the postmark is missing or damaged and no additional information is provided by the U.S. Postal Service or other mail delivery service, the ballot identification envelope will be date stamped upon receipt by an election official on or before Election Day. The District of Columbia Board of Elections reported 55 Twenty two states indicated that the item asking for a postmark deadline for voters does not apply to them. 56 States that reported having a ballot receipt deadline after Election Day require ballots to be postmarked by Election Day. 57 Information on deadlines for returning mail ed ballots was collected in item Q20 of the Policy Survey. 58 Two states did not provide a response to this item. 59 Information on the length of time that ballots are tracked for reporting in EAVS Section C was collected in item Q21 of the Policy Survey. Maine reported tracking until November 3, 2022. 60 Thirteen states reported not requiring a postmark for mailed ballots six states did not provide a response to this item. South Dakota explained that they do not honor postmarks for ballots Minnesota also commented that they do not use postmarks. 61 Florida specifie d that physical postmarks are only required for 10 day overseas ballots. See httpsdos.myflorida.com electionsfor votersvotingmilitary andoverseas citizens voting for more detail on these ballots. 62 In Washington, the postmark requirement may be met by a date on a voter affidavit for UOCAVA ballots that lack a postmark. 63 Information on mailed ballot postmark requirements was collected in item Q22 of the Policy Survey. Election Law and Procedure  73 that they make ballot drop boxes available to voters through Election Day, which satisfie s postmark requirements. UOCAVA Voti ng UOCAVA requires that all states offer uniformed services members, their eligible family members, and overseas citizens the ability to vote absentee in all federal elections. UOCAVA protected citizens have the option of using the FPCA, which serves as both a registration and ballot request application and is accepted in all U.S. states and territories. All states accept FP CAs submitted by postal mail. In addition, the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment MOVE Act amended UOCAVA, requiring that all states offer an electronic means for FPCA submission. UOCAVA voters may submit their FPCA by fax, online either by email o r through the states online voter registration portal, or by other modes, as allowed by state law. All states are required to accept FPCAs by postal mail. In 2020, the most common additional methods for accepting FPCAs were email and fax  both modes were allowed in over 90 of states. Twenty four states 42.9, an increase from 36.4 in 2018  reported accep ting FPCAs submitted through the states online voter registration portal. 64 Some states reported that FPCAs can be submitted by some ot her method South Carolina and Colorado indicated allow ing inperson returns , and Louisiana indicated allow ing returns by commercial carrier. Oklahoma reported allow ing UOCAVA voters to email their ballot materials to FVAPs electronic transmission service , after which the email is converted to fax and sent to the appropriate county election board. Maine specified allow ing UOCAVA voters to request an absentee ballot through the states online absentee ballot request service. A voter registration submitted via FPCA is considered permanent in 53.6  of states a decrease from 72.7 in 2018 and temporary in 46.4  of states an increase from 25.5 in 2018. 65 St ates differ in the length of time an FPCA absentee ballot request remains valid that is, the period of time or number of elections for which a voter can retain their UOCAVA status and have an absentee ballot transmitted to them.66 Almost half  46.4  of states reported that the length of time the FPCA will serve as a ballot request mechanism is a specified number of calendar years in most of those states, the length of time is one year, alt hough in North Dakota, Utah, and Virginia, it is two years. In other states, the length of time is measured by the number of general election cycles 12.5 most of those states specified a length of one general election cycle, although Minnesota and Oklahoma specified two general election cycles . Some states 8.9 r eported that they will use the FPCA as a ballot request mechanism until the voter moves from their residence. 67 64 Maryland reported allowing the three listed options if the voter is already registered and is using the FPCA to request an absentee ballot. If the FPCA is used to register, it must be submitted by mail or through Marylands online voter registration portal. In Wisconsin, non military UOCAVA voters cannot submit registrations, including the FPCA, by email or fax. 65 Information on the methods by which UOCAVA voters can submit an FPCA, other than by postal mail, was collected in item Q26 of the Policy Survey. Information on whether a voter registration submitted through an FPCA is permanent or temporary was collected in item Q27 of the Pol icy Survey. 66 Information on how long UOCAVA voters remain eligible to receive absentee ballots was collected in item Q28 of the Policy Survey. 67 This information is provided by the U.S. Postal Service or the voter. 74  Election Law and Procedure About onethird 32.1 of states provided a description of another length of time that was unlisted in the Policy Survey question, with some states making distinctions between general and primary elections and others reporting a time linked with either a specific election timeline or a length of time tied to the submission of the FPCA. Nevada reported that voters retain their status until the end of the following calendar year , and Maine reported that the status remains eligible for 18 months. American Samoa, Oregon, and Washington specified a timeline based on changes to a voters registration record. C alifornia, New Jersey, and North Carolina reported that eligibility remains permanent. Voters also continue to remain eligible in Pennsylvania, as long as they are registered to vote and they reapply for an absentee ballot each election cycle. The Northern Mariana Islands also reported that they require all registered voters to request their absentee ballots each election year. UOCAVA Voting Deadlines In addition to reporting deadlines for mail ed ballots from non UOCAVA voters, the 2020 Policy Survey asked states to report deadlines for ba llots submitted by both uniformed services voters residing in the United States and overseas UOCAVA voters. States provided information on both postmark deadlines and ballot receipt deadlines, as applicable. In 2020, the po stmark deadline was Election Day in about half of the states 48.2 for domestic uniformed services voters however, in Iowa, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania , the postmark deadline was one day before Election Day.68 Just under half of the states  41.1 reported that ballots had to have been received by Election Day, and 58.9 of the states indicated that the ballots must have been received by a specified number of days after Election Day, with responses ranging from two to 20 days after Election Day.69 Fo r overseas UOCAVA voters, Election Day was the postmark deadline in half of the states. The three states mentioned above also reported having a postmark deadline one day before Election Day for these voters.70 Ballots in 39.3 of the states were requir ed to be received by Election Day in the remaining 60.7 of states ballots could arrive after Election Day and still remain eligible to be counted, with the deadlines ranging from two to 20 days after Election Day . The majority of states 83.7 reported that they have the same postmark requirements for UOCAVA ballots and mail ed ballots from nonUOCAVA voters.71 Eight states indicated that the requirements are different.72 Fo r more information about how UOCAVA voters participated in the 2020 general election, including ballots transmitted, returned, counted, and rejected , and the use of the Federal Write In Absentee Ballot FWAB, see Chapter 4 of this report. 68 Twentythree states indicated that the item asking for a postmark deadline for domestic military UOCAVA voters does not apply to them. 69 Information on deadlines for ballots submitted by uniformed services voters residing in the United States was collected in item Q29 of the Policy Survey. 70 Twenty two states indicated that the item asking for a postmark deadline for overseas UOCAVA voters does not apply to them. 71 Seven states did not provide a response to this item. West Virginia does not require postmarks. 72 Information on deadlines for b allots submitted by overseas UOCAVA voters was collected in item Q30 in the Policy Survey. Information on the differences between postmark requirements for UOCAVA and non UOCAVA voters was collected in item Q31 in the Policy Survey. Election Law and Procedure  75 InPerson Voting The traditional image of voting in America involves voters physically traveling to a polling location and casting their ballots in person. In some cases, however, an individual may vote in person without having to go to a polling place on Election Day. InPerson Voting Before Election Day Most states reported that they allow individuals to cast their ballots in person before Election Day not including the hand delivery of mail ed ballots .73 This type of voting generally falls into two categories A voter may go to a polling place before Election Day, receive a ballot, vote t heir ballot while at the polling place, and place their completed ballot into a ballot box or tabulator. A voter may go to an election office to pick up a ballot over the counter. In some states, the voter may be able to take their ballot home with them, w hereas in other states , the ballot must be completed in the office. The ballot is then sealed in an envelope and tabulated along withballots that are returned to the office by mail according to local procedures. Different states use the terms in person early voting and in person absentee voting to describe both of the voting methods above, although other terms exist as well. Some states offer both types of voting activities. Table 3.

Twelve states  21.4 reported requiring an excuse to vote in person before Election Day, a decrease from the 15 states that reported this policy in 2018.75 Vote Centers The EAC describes vote centers as centralized, consolidated polling sites that serve as alternatives to traditional polling places.76 Jurisdictions that use vote centers allow voters to cast their Election Day ballots at any vote center in their jurisdiction , rather than needing to vote at a specifically assigned polling place . The 2020 Policy Survey asked whether any of the state s jurisdictions allow voters to cast ballots at any polling place or vote center in their jurisdiction and to describe how vote centers operate. Over one third of states  37.5  reported having vote centers or allowing voters to cast ballots at any polling place in the voters jurisdiction. Eight of those states  38.1  indicated that they require the use of vote centers statewide. Another eight reported having vote centers, but jurisdictions have the option not to implement them. Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas comprising 23.8 of the states reported having vote centers, but only in jurisdictions that meet specific requirements. 77 Voter Identification Under HAVA, Congress establishe d minimum identification standards that an individual must meet in order to register to vote Individuals who register to vote at their states motor vehicle agency, another governmentagency, or using an online registration portal are typically authenticated by presentingappropriate documentation to the government agency and by the state matching the persons drivers license number or last four digits of their social security number to an existing state record. Individuals who register by mail and who have not voted before for federal office in their state of residence are required to present, at some point before voting, either a current and validphoto identification or a copy of a utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, orother government document that shows the persons name and address. 74 Information on the terminology used to describe the process of voting in person before Election Day was collected in item Q24 of the Policy Survey. States were able to select multiple response options. 75 Information on whether an excuse is required to vote in person before Election Day was collected in item Q24a of the Policy Survey. 76 U.S. Election Assistance Commission. 2017, November 11.

Information on how vote centers operate was collected in item Q25a of t he Policy Survey. Election Law and Procedure  77 Individuals who are entitled to vote by absentee ballot under UOCAVA or entitled to vote other than in person under the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act or otherfederal law are exempt from HAVAs identification requirements. The definition of voter identification varies by state. In some states it can mean a government issued document with a photograph, whereas in other states, it can mean a voter executed affidavit affirming identity. For in person, non firsttime voting whether before or on Election Day, most states 53.6 reported that they require voters to present a government issued photo identification as proof of their identity. 78 Twenty states 35.7 reported allowing voters to present a government  issued, nonphoto identification, and 24 states 42.9 reported allowing non government issued, nonphoto identification. Some states reported allowing a proof of residence 32.1, a signed affidavit affirming identity with no further action required 37.5 or with the r equirement of presenting proper identification before a provisional ballot is counted 23.2, or in some cases, voters may have a person registered to vote within that jurisdiction vouch for their identity 12.5. Five states 8.9 reported that they do not have identification requirements for in person voting. 79 Provisional Voting The EAC has provided best practices on the development of provisional voting procedures and notice to voters to ensure provisional voting procedures are fair, transparent, eff ective, and consistently applied to all voters in the state. The EAC states in its Best Practices on Provisional Voting report Section 302 of the Help America Vote Act HAVA creates the right for potential voters to cast provisional ballots in the event their names do not appear on the registration list or the voters eligibility is challenged by an election official. The issuance of a provisional ballot is best described as a safety net or fail safe for the voter, in that It maintains the persons intent to vote and selections until election officials determine thatthe person does or does not have the right to cast a ballot in the election. It allows the determination of the voters eligibility to be made at a time when more perfect or complete information is available either from the voter or from the election jurisdiction. 80 HAVA specifies minimum requirements for notice to voters and provides opportunities fo r voters to resolve eligibility issues. Within the federal framework, states have different methods of complying with the provisional notification to voter requirements, using different technology and different timetables. State and local election officials ultimately apply their policies, procedures, and state legal requirements when making a determination as to whether or not to count a provisional ballot. For example, a state that has a stricter standard for the identification of voters than is contained in HAVA would apply its standard to determine if a given provisional ballot meets the states ID standard. 78 Two states did not provide a response to the item asking about identification requirements. 79 Information on establishing a voters identity during in person voting was collected in item Q36 of the Policy Survey. 80 U.S. Election Assista nce Commission. 2017, February 27.

Fif ty states reported using provisional ballots for different reasons. The most common reason was an election official has asserted an individual is not eligible to vote.81 Table 4 provides a full list of reasons the states use provisional ballots. If a voter casts a provisional ballot as a result of not having acceptable identification during voting, the deadline by which they must present appropriate identification to election officials to verify their identity and to have their provisional ballot accepted was most commonly reported as a specified number of days after Election Day. The 11 states that have this policy reported a range of one to nine days after Election Day. However, in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, the deadline for adjudicating provisional ballots for the 2020 general election was a specified date November 6, 2020. 82 81 Information on whether states use provisional ballots was collected in item Q32 of the Policy Survey. Information on the circumstances under which a state will use provisional ballots was collected in item Q32a of the Policy Survey. 82 Information on deadlines for presenting appropriate identification to have a provisional ballot counted was collected in item Q36a of the Policy Survey. Election Law and Procedure  79 After the election, many states have a limited amount of time in which to adjudicate provisional ballots and decide whether the ballots will be counted either in full or in part or rejected.83 Twenty  six percent of the states that use provisional ballots reported that the deadline is by a specified date for the November 3, 2020, general election, these dates ranged from November 3, 2020 , to November 24, 2020. M ost states 70 indicated that this deadline is specified as a number of days after Election Day, with responses ranging between one day and 28 days.84 Eight percent of the states that use provisional ballots reported provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct would be fully counted, and 40 of the states reported that they would be partially counted.85 Slightly more than half of the states 52 reported that these ballo ts would be rejected.86 Election Technology Voting system testing and certification are required in the majority of states 83.9 by statute, and a few states 10.7 indicated that they require testing and certification through a formal administrative rule or guidance. American Samoa, Mississippi, and Oklahoma reported that voting system testing and certification before the system s approval for purchase is not required. The 2020 Policy S urvey then asked states to describe their policies regarding the role of the EAC and federal testing and certification. States most commonly reported requiring testing by an EAC accredited Voting System Test Laboratory VSTL  45.3, certification to the EAC adopted Voluntary Voting System Guidelines VVSG  43.4, andor state and federal certification 41.5 see Figure 7.87 Some states provided clarifying comments  The District of Columbia reported that it requires that voting systems must meet or exceed HAVA standards andor be federally certified. Similarly, Oregon reported that the system must be EAC certified or examined by a federally accredited VSTL. New York indicated that a secondary source code review is performed by an independent security expert. Alaska reported that it may approve a voting system upon consideration by an election administrator,88 and Guam indicated having an independent entity that conducts testing to determine the integrity of voting machines as deemed appropriat e by election commissioners. Wisconsin reported having the statutory authority to certify systems without federal certification, but in practice, state testing typically does not s tart until federal certification is acquired. Although there is no testing o r certification of electronic poll books, sometimes called e poll books, on the federal level, many states have their own process for testing or certifying these machines 83 One state did not provide a response to this item. In Maine, provisional ballots are automatically counted unless a recount results in a contested election and the number of challenged ballots can affect the outcome. 84 Information on the deadlines for adjudicating provisional ballots is collected in Policy Survey item Q32b. 85 For example, a state might only count items on the ballot for which the voter would have been eligible had they voted in the correct precinct. 86 Information on what h appens to provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct is collected in Policy Survey item Q32c. 87 Information on voting system testing and certification policies was collected in items Q15 and Q15a of the Policy Survey. 88 AK Stat  15.20.910 2016 80  Election Law and Procedure Figure 7.

Of the 40 states 71.4 that reported using epoll book s either statewide or only in certain jurisdictions, 42.5 indicated that they do not require testing or certification before the epoll books approval for purchase.89 In about one third of the states that reported having epoll book requirements , the testi ng and certification are required by statute, whereas in one fourth of the states , testin g and certification are required by formal administrative rule or guidance.90 The 2020 Policy Survey asked whether any jurisdiction s in the state use epoll books and whether testing and certification are required before e poll books approval for purchase. The Policy Survey and EAVS d id not collect data on other procedures a jurisdiction may require before authorizing the 89 Colorado, Hawaii, and Massachusetts reported in the Policy Survey that they use e poll books but did not report data on the usage of e poll books in item F3 of the EAVS. Puerto Rico reported data on the usage of e poll books i n the EAVS but reported not using e poll books in the Policy Survey. 90 Information on poll books was collected in items Q1 6 and Q1 6a of the Policy Survey. Illinois did not provide a response to this item. Election Law and Procedure  81 use of e poll books, including b ut not limited to pre election testing, secure physical storage, contingency planning, chainof custody practices, and poll worker training. Recounts, Audits, and Election Certification Before local election officials certify the results of an election, they take steps to verify that all established election procedures were followed and that all voting equipment functioned properly. Many states require additional post election verification that the counting process was accurate. These additional verifications may take the form of a partial recount in which ballots in randomly selected precincts are counted a second time to ensure that the initial tabulation of votes was accurate or a more detailed audit in which the entire voting process is reviewed and key steps are verified. Recounts An election recount is a repeat tabulation of all votes cast in an election , and it is used to determine the accuracy of an initial count . The EAVS Policy Survey did not ask if the reasons for a recount were automatic, mandatory, or triggered. The information collected in these questions quantifies what is generally allowed by law in a specified state. Figure 8 displays the reasons why states may have conducted a n election recount for the 2020 general election. States reported that the most common reason a recount may be conducted is at the request of an affected candidate or party  55.4 . Less common reasons were if the results of a contest are within a specified margin  37.5, another person or group requests a recount  30.4 , 91 or if the results of a contest are within a specified margin and it is requested by an affected candidate or party  28.6 . Arizona, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, the Northern Mari ana Islands, and Tennessee reported that recounts are only authorized if a court orders it.92 91 Based on state comments, this reason can include voters or groups of voters, a county board of canvassers, a county election commission, a political party chair, or a person opposing a state or local measure. Washington specified that a group of five or m ore voters may request a recount for an issue, and Nevada specified that any person or group could request a recount of a ballot measure by November 18, 2020. 92 Information on state policies regarding election recounts was collected in item Q34 of the Policy Survey. 82  Election Law and Procedure Figure 8.

The majority of states  78.6  indicated requir ing some form of post election tabulation audit, with some variation .93 States most commonly indicated that a post election audit is conducted as a statutory requirement, but Missour i and Nebraska stated that they conduct an audit as required by a formal administrative rule or guidance. Tennessee indicated only requiring a post election tabulation audit for jurisdictions using optical scan voting systems. In Oklahoma, the secretary of the state election board can direct the secretary of a county election board to conduct post election audits to ensure that voting devices and software correctly tabulated votes . Louisiana reported that it does not statutorily require tabulation audits, but audits are conducted in all parishes . The Policy Survey did not collect 93 Information on whether a state requires a post election tabulation audit was collected in item Q35 of the Policy Survey . Louisiana is not included in this calculation because it reported that Our state does not statutorily require audits, but they are conducted in every parish.  Election Law and Procedure  83 information on whether these audits were mandatory, triggered, or conducted only in certain circumstances. The 2020 Policy Survey asked states to report which of the following post election tabulation audits would be required for the 2020 general election. States could select multiple options as applicable A traditional tabulation audit that comes from a fixed percenta ge of randomly selected voting districts or voting machines and is compared to the results produced by the voting system  A risklimiting tabulation audit that is a protocol designed to limit the risk of certifying an incorrect election outcome by using st atistical methods to select the audit sample size or Another type of audit. Roughly three quarters of the states reported requiring a traditional tabulation audit, and about one fifth of the states reported requiring a risk limiting tabulation audit.94 Thirteen states  28.9 provided comments detailing alternative procedures.95 For example, California stated that a jurisdiction may choose to conduct a risklimiting audit instead of a traditional tabulation audit, and Nevada noted that after an initial pilot tabulation audit conducted after the 2020 general election, the state will require risk limiting tabulation audits starting after the 2022 primary electi on. Pennsylvania also reported that it piloted a risk limiting tabulation audit after the 2020 general election in addition to their statutory requirement. Some states reported having additional steps in their tabulation audit processes . For example, Mary land stated that it conducts a traditional manual audit as well as a completely automated tabulation audit using ballot images. Louisiana noted that its tabulation audit includes a comparison between the number of times a machine was used for voting, the number of voters that signed a precinct register, the names written in the precinct poll books, and the voters who were given credit for voting in the statewide database. Washington reported that local election officials can choose among three methods to me et the state post election tabulation audit requirement, including the option for a risk limiting audit. Election Certification Although some local jurisdictions might have earlier deadlines for finalizing election results, elections are not officially cer tified until the state provides a final result. The 2020 Policy Survey asked states to provide their election certification deadlines for the 2020 general election . 96 The range was broad,97 with 41 states reporting a date between November 10, 2020 , and November 30, 2020 .98 94 Information on the type of post election tabulation audit that states require was collected in item Q35a of the Policy Survey . States were able to make multiple selections in this items response options. 95 In Louisiana, postelection tabulation audits were conducted by comparing all voting machine results to the number of voters that signed the precinct register, the names written in the precinct poll books, and the voters given credit for voting in the statewide database. However, Louisiana specified that post election tabulation audits were not statutorily required for the 2020 general election . 96 Hawaii does not have an election certification deadline results are certified within 20 days of the election unless the Supreme Court has contested an election. 97 The range was as early as November 4, 2020 , in Puerto Rico and as late as December 11, 2020 , in California. 98 Information on deadlines for certifying the November 2020 general election results was collected in item Q33 of the Policy Survey . 84  Election Law and Procedure States provided clarifying comments on their specific policies regarding their certification deadline. For example, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Rhode Island reported not having a specific state certification deadline,99 and the District of Columbia and Guam noted that their reported dates were tentative deadlines. Additionally, Alaska commented that their reported date was a target deadline , and North Carolina noted their reported deadline was barring recounts or protests in individual races. 99 Tennessee and Pennsylvania noted that their reported deadlines apply to county officials, not state officials.

Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond Key Findings The Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS collected data on voter registration between the 201 8 and the 2020 general elections in Section A of the survey . Election officials were asked a variety of questions relating to registration and list mainte nance, including the number of persons registered and eligible to vote in the 20 20 general election, the number of registration forms processed , the number of confirmation notices sent pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act NVRA and for other pu rposes , and the number of records removed from the voter registration rolls. Notable findings from Section A of the 2020 EAVS include The number of registrations received between the 2018 and the 2020 general elections reached 103,701,513, a 33.8 increas e in registrations received compared to the period leading to the 2016 general election. The states departments of motor vehicles DMV were once again the most commonly used registration source and accounted for 39.3 of the total registrations received between the 2018 and the 2020 general elections . Online registration continued to be the second most used registration method, accounting for 28.2 of the total registrations received , and it was the registration method with the larg est growth in the two year period leading to the 2020 general election. The total number of reported active registrants reached 209,441,338 nationwide. The total number of active registration s for the 2020 general election increased 8.3  compared to the 2016 general election. States reported removing 18,781,054 voter records from voter registration rolls between the 2018 and the 2020 general elections. More than half of these removals occurred because a registrant failed to return a confirmation notice and did not vote in the following two general elections, or because the registrant moved out of the voting jurisdiction. Introduction Voter registration is required in 49 states,1 all of the U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia, making registration the first step toward election participation for most voters.2 Registration serves multiple purposes I t allows election officials to confirm if a person is eligible to vote permits officials to efficiently allocate resources such as ballots, poll workers, and voting equipment, depending on 1 Throughout this report, unless otherwise specified, the term state can be understood to apply to the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia , and five U.S. territories American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that submit Election Administration Policy Survey and EAVS data. 2 North Dakota is the only state that does not require voter registration. Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  115 the number of registrants per precinct and jurisdiction 3 and allows the tracking of voter participation. Congress passed the NVRA in 1993 t o establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for federal office .4 This act, commonly known as the Motor Voter Law, requires that states offer the opportunity to register to vote at their motor vehicle licensing offices known as the DMV in many states. The law also requires states to offer voter registration at offices that provide public assistance or state funded programs that primarily engage in providing services to pers ons with disabilities, and at armed services recruitment offices. The NVRA also provides guidelines on registration list maintenance and sets limits on how voters can be removed from the rolls. 5 The Help America Vote Act HAVA of 2002 charged the U.S. Election Assistance Commission  EAC with collecting data on voter registration and list maintenance procedures. The EAC meets its statutory requirement to report to Congress on the impact of the NVRA via Section A of the EAVS.6 This chapter of the EAVS report not only fulfills this requirement, but also provides insight about the changes in the registration behaviors of Americans in federal general elections and about the changes in the state policies affecting the registration process. Federal Laws Regulating Voter Registration The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 The NVRA is the primary federal law governing voter registration in the United States. In this law, Congress provides a clear statement regarding the importance of voter registratio n 1the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right 2it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise of that right and 3 What constitutes a jurisdiction for EAVS reporting is defined by how each state chose to provide data . For the 2020 EAVS, most states repor ted data on the county level or county equivalent, such as parishes for Louisiana. Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, and Virginia reported data for in dependent cities in addition to counties. The territories, the District of Columbia, and Alaska each repor ted as a single jurisdiction. Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin repor ted data on the township lev el. Maine also reported its UOCAVA data in Section B as a separate jurisdiction , because this information was only collected at the state level. Michigan reported data for the county level, but most election administration activities take place in the 1,52 0 local election jurisdictions in the state . 4 52 U.S.C.  20501. 5 This report generally uses the term voter registration rolls to refer to the computerized databases of registered voters that are maintained by states and localities. Other common terms for these databases include voter registration lists and voter registration records. 6 Before 2016, the EAC administered a separate survey called the NVRA Survey, which collected similar information. This survey was consolidated with the EAVS for the 2 016 general election. Before the creation of the EAC, the NVRA Survey was administered by the Federal Election Commission. 116  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond 3discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures ca n h ave a direct and damaging effect on voter participation in elections for Federal office and disproportionately harm voter participation by various groups, including racial minorities.7 The prim ary purposes of the NVRA are 1to establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal office 2to make it possible for Federal, State, and local governments to implement this Act NVRA in a manner that enhances the participation of eligible citizens as voters in elections for Federal office 3to protect the integrity of the electoral process and 4to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.8 The NVR As first purpose is to expand opportunities for voters to register by creating more uniform processes for voter registration and designating more places and methods to register to vote. The NVRA requires that states allow multiple methods and places to register to vote, includin g 1 motor vehicle departments when a person obtains , renews , or updates the address on their drivers license 2 through the mail, using a standard registration form 9 3 at all state offices providing public assistance e.g., the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  SNAP  4 at all offices that provide state funded programs focused on services to people with disabilities 5 a t armed forces recruitment offices and 6 at other state designated offices such as public libraries and local government offices. All these offices are mandated under the NVRA to provide their users with information on voter registration and assistance in the registration process when required. The NVR A also sets some fundamental guidelines that states must follow. For example, states may set their own deadline for citizens to register to vote in a general election for federal offices, but that deadline can never be more than 30 days before the date of the election. The NVRA also sets the 7 52 U.S.C.  20501 8 52 U.S.C.  20507 9 States can make available the standard National Mail Voter Registration Form provided by the EAC httpswww.eac.govvotersnational mailvoter registration form  or their own version of a mail registration form following the NVRAs requirements. The NVRA was fully implemented after the 1994 general election . Several states are not covered by the NVRA. North Dakota is exempt because it does not have voter registration. The U.S. territories are also not subject to the NVRA, and the states of Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyomin g are exempt because they had same day registration SDR in 1994 and have continued to make this option available uninterrupted since that time. Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  117 process that states need to follow to maintain their voter registration rolls and to conduct removal processes. Help America Vote Act of 2002 HAVA HAVA was enacted with the goal of updating the voting administration system in the United States and creating a commission to assist in the administration of federal elections. In addition to legislating the update of the administration process for federal elections in the United States, HAVA mandates that states create and maintain a computerized statewide voter registration list that serves as the official vote r registration list for the conduct of all elections for Federal office in the State. 10 The computerized registration list must be centralized and defined, maintained and administered at the State level.11 However, although the registration list is administered at the state level, local election official s must be able to access the registr ation list and are required to enter any updated voter registration information in the computerized system. HAVA also specifies that the maintenance of the implemented computerized registration list will be carried out according to the NVRAs mandates and that duplicate names or registrations will be removed from the states registration list. State Voter Registration Policies States have wide latitude on how to conduct their voter registration activities, as long as the state policies do not interfere with federal laws such as the NVRA and HAVA. This flexibility allows states to adapt their laws as they see appropriate to better serve the interests of their citizens. During the period between the 2018 and the 2020 general elections, a number of states changed their laws regarding voter registration, such as implementing online voter registration, allowing voters to register at the poll s on Election Day, or implementing automatic registration. 12 These types of laws usually take years between when they are first proposed and when they are fully implemented. However, states can make short term changes to their registration policies with the aim of addressing unforeseen circumstances. For example, the state of Massachusetts changed its registration deadline to allow its citizens an additional 10 days to register given the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID 19 pandemic. 13 Additionally, some states briefly extended their registration deadlines due to issues with their online registration sites that made it impossible to register to vote in the hours before the end of the registration period these issues were in some cases caused by an unprecedented volume of attempted visits.14 10 52 U.S.C.  21083 11 Ibid. 12 These registration policies will be covered in more detail in the following section of this c hapter .

Citizens in the United States can register to vote using different methods, some of them mandated by federal law and others offered at the discretion of the state. Once a registration form is complet ed and submitted, the state or loca l election office must confirm the eligibility of the applicant. Eligible applicants are added to the voter registration rolls and are notified of their registration status, whereas applicants who submitted ineligible or incomplete applica tions are contact ed for further information to complete their applications. Figure 1. The Voter Registration Process Note Fi gure 1 does not represent automatic registration, in which the voter does not submit a registration application. Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  119 Voter registration also serves to assign each voter to a precinct a bounded geographic area to which voters are assigned according to their residential address as listed in their voter registration record  so that voters receive the correct ballot. The voter registration system tracks each voters electoral participation so that an individual can be given credit for voting in an election, which helps ensure each person casts only one ballot per election. Every person with a valid registration is considered an active, registered voter. However, at times, a question arises as to whether a person still resides at the address at which they are registered . The election official may receive notification via the U.S. Postal Service national change of address from the voter of a new residen t address. In these situations, the state or local election office may send the registrant a confirmation of address notice. In many states, if the person fails to return the form or the form is returned to the election office as undeliverable, the person is placed on a list of inactive voters. Inactive voters are still part of the voter registration rolls and are included in the registration totals in most jurisdictions. 15 However, before they can vote, inactive voters are typically required to show approved documentation of their eligibility most commonly, proof of living at an address within the voting jurisdiction. In some cases, inactive voters may be required to cast a provisional ballot when their eligibility cannot be established at the polls. The NVRA also requires states to maint ain their voter registration rolls by removing registrants who are no longer eligible to vote . For example, the NVRA provides that if a registrant fails to return a confirmation notice and does not vote in two subsequent federal general elections, the registrant can be removed from the voter registration roll of the jurisdiction that sent the confirmation notice . In addition, a registrant can be removed for other rea sons such as death, upon the registrants request, or due to a disqualifying criminal conviction or mental incompetence , as provided by a states laws. This process is referred to as list maintenance. When an individual is removed from the voter registration roll because of a change in residence of the voter under the NVRA process, this is called address list maintenance. Election offices may share data with other state agencies or entities that maintain death records or felony and prison records for the purposes of identifying potentially ineligible voters. 16 How Americans Register ed to Vote for the 2020 General Election Between the close of registration for the 2018 general election and the close of registration for the 2020 general election, states and territories reported receiving a record 103,701,513 registration applications26,184,917 more applications than were received in the same period leading up to the 2016 general election. 17 The most used method of registration was the motor vehicle departm ents, which accounted for 39.3 of the total registrations received 39,705,812 registration 15 According t o the 2020 Policy Survey, six states Guam, Idaho, North Dakota, New Hampshire, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Wyoming reported that they do not distinguish between active and inactive voters in their registration records. In the survey comments in the EAVS, Oregon reported , Do not track number of inactive voters , and Minnesota stated , Minnesota is NVRA exempt. Minnesota does not classify voters as inactive per NVRA. 16 More information about state policies on voter registration database linkages is found in Chapter 2 of this report. 17 The total number of registration applications received during the two year period leading to a federal general election was reported in item A3a in the 2020 EAVS and item A5a in the 2016 EAVS. 120  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond applications.18 Registration by mail accounted for 12.9, inperson registration accounted for 8.3, and online registration accounted for 28.2 of the total regi stration applications.19 The rest of the registration applications that were received during this period were from sources such as registration drives 2.2, public assistance offices 1.6, and armed forces recruiting offices 0.1 among other sources. 20 The primary sources of registration have remained fairly consistent throughout multiple elections. For instance, motor vehicle departments have been the most common source of voter registration for over a decade, accounting for more than 30 of the received registrations since at least 2006. 21 Figure 2 shows that other sources for filing registration applications , such as in person at election offices, by mailfaxemail , and other means e.g., public assistance offices, registration drives , were used at very similar rates as for the 2018 general election. Online registration has been the second most popular registration mode since 2016 and accounted for a proportionately larger share of registration applications for the 2020 general election. In 2020, online applications increased 12.1 percentage points compared to the registration period leading to 18 The percentage of registrations received by the motor vehicl e department was calculated by dividing the number of registration applications received at motor vehicle departments item A4d of the EAVS by the total number of registration applications received item A3a of the EAVS. American Samoa, Idaho, New Hampsh ire, North Dakota, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Wisconsin , and Wyoming were not included in the calculation because they did not report data on item A4d. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 19 The percentage of registrations received by mail, in person, and online used items A4a, A4b , and A4c of the EAVS respectively, and were divided by the total number of registration applications received item A3a of the EAVS. Guam, North Dakota, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, and the U.S. Virgin Islands were not included in the calculation of the percentage of registrations received by mail because they did not report data on item A4a. North Dakota and Rhode Island were not included in the c alculation of the percentage of registrations received in person because they did not report data on item A4b. American Samoa, Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, Rhode Is land, South Dakota, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Wyoming were not included in the calculation of the percentage of registrations received online because they did not report data on item A4c. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in these calculatio ns. 20 The percentage of registrations received from registration drives, public assistance offices, and armed forces recruiting offices used items A4i, A4e, and A4g of the EAVS respectively, and were divided by the total number of registration applications received item A3a of the EAVS. American Samoa, Georgia, Guam, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, the Northern Mariana Islands, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, the U.S. Virgin Islands, West Virginia , and Wyoming were not included in the calculation of the percentage of registrations received from registration drives because they did not report data on item A4i. American Samoa, Guam, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming were not included in the calculation of the percentage of registrations received a t public assistance offices because they did not report data on item A4e. American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, the Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Isl and, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin , and Wyoming were not included in the calculation of the percentage of registrations received at armed forces recruiting offices because they did not report data on item A4g. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in these calculations. The instructions for this question noted that registration applications should be classified according to the mode used to submit it. For example, if the voter submits a registration form online using the states online voter registration portal, this is considered an online voter registration. If the voter accessed the online v oter registration system at a state public assistance office or at the office of an agency that primarily serves individuals with disabilities, this would also be considered an online registration. 21 The EACs National Voter Registration Act Studies, which contain information on voter registration activities prior to 2016 when this information began being included in the EAVS Comprehensive Report, can be found at httpswww.eac.gov votersnational voter registration actstudies . Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  121 Figure 2. Motor Vehicle Departments A re the Most Common Source of Registration Applications Source The percentage of registrations received at motor vehicle departments was calculated as A4dA3a x 100 for the 2018 and the 2020 EAVS and A6dA5a x 100 for the 2016 EAVS. The percentage of registrations received online was calculated as A4cA3a x 10 0 for the 2018 and the 2020 EAVS and A6cA5a x 100 for the 2016 EAVS. The percentage of registrations received by mailfaxemail was calculated as A4aA3a x 100 for the 2018 and the 2020 EAVS and A6aA5a x 100 for the 2016 EAVS. The percentage of registrations received in person was calculated as A4bA3a x 100 for the 2018 and the 2020 EAVS and A6bA5a x 100 for the 2016 EAVS. The percentage of registrations received by other means was calculated as A4eA4fA4gA4hA4iA4jA4kA4lA3a x 100 for the 2018 a nd the 2020 EAVS and A6eA6fA6gA6hA6iA6jA6kA6lA6mA6nA6oA5a x 100 for the 2016 EAVS. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in these calculations. the 20 18 general election and was the registration source with the largest growth. Some of this growth in online registration applications could have been because of the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic, as many of the typical in person modes of registration were restricted starting in March 2020. The percentages of registrations received at mo tor vehicle departments and in person at election offices saw small decreases from 2018 to 2020. 122  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond Another explanation for the growth in the use of online registration between 2018 and 2020 is that three states Minnesota, New Jersey, and Oklahoma began to offer online registration.22 This resulted in a total of 43 states that allowed voters to submit new registration applications online for the 2020 general election. 23 These registrations are typically reviewed electronically, and data from other state data bases are used to verify a persons identity, address, and eligibility. Most of the states 81.4 using online registration reported that applicants must have a drivers license issued by the state to register online.24 Two more states Mississippi and Texas reported that they allow voters to update their registration records online, but voters may not submit new registration applications online. Stat es reported receiving 27,681,700 online registrations during the 2018 2020 registration period.25 Nineteen states reported receiving more than 30 of their registrations online in 2020 see Table 2 of the Appendix. Among states that reported receiving online registrations in 2018 and 2020, only Iowa and Connecticut reported a decrease in the percentage of their registrations received online  a 5.2 and 3. 6percentage point decrease, respectively, and 26 states reported an increase of 10 percentage points or more.26 As in 2018, Massachusetts 67.4 was the state with the highest percentage of online registrations.27 The first state to implement online registration, Arizona, also remained among the states with the highest levels of registrations received online 45.2. Same Day Voter Registration Same day registration  SDR allow s voters to register to vote and cast their ballot on the same day. SDR can be offered on Election Day, in which case it may be referred to as Election Day registration, or it can be offered during in person early voting. 28 SDR depends on local laws and, t hus, is only allowed in some states and territories. Some states reported allowing SDR in narrow circumstances, such as only for particular elections e.g., Alaska and Rhode Island reported only allo wing SDR for voting for the U.S. President and Vice President or particular cases e.g., North Carolina reported 22 Information was collected f rom responses to items Q7 in the 2020 Policy Survey and Q6 in the 2018 Policy Survey . The states of Minnesota, New Jersey, and Oklahoma reported using online registration for the 2020 g eneral election, but not in 2018. Mississippi and Texas reported offering an online option only to update reg istrations and did not report any online registration in item A4c of the EAVS. 23 More information about state policies on online registration is found in Chapter 2 of this report. 24 The percentage of states requiring a driver s license or other ID issued b y the state to register to vote used item Q7a in the 2020 Policy Survey and was calculated by dividing the number of states that require a state issued ID by the total number of states that reported allowing individuals to register to vote online in Q7 of the 2020 Policy Survey. 25 The total number of online registration applications received during the two year period leading to a federal general election was reported in item A4c in the 2020 EAVS. 26 The percentage of registrations received online in 2020 used item A4c of the 2020 EAVS divided by the total number of registration applications received item A3a of the 2020 EAVS. The calculation of online registrations received in 2018 used the same item number from the 2018 EAVS data set. The comparison subtr acted the percentage of registrations received online in 2020 from the percentage of registrations received online in 2018 to obtain the percentage point difference. Texas was not included among the states that received online registrations in 2018 and 202 0, because they reported zero as the response for A4c in all of the counties. 27 Illinois reported 96.4 of online registrations but was omitted here , because it reported more than twice as many registrations in the categories breakdown than were reported in the item reporting total registrations received A3a. 28 Some states may have an overlap between their mail voting period and the close of their voter registration, during which it is possible for a person to register on the same day that they cast a mailed ballot  however, this is not considered SDR for purpos es of the EAVS, and many states have noted in the past that it is not possible to track the number of mail voters who register to vote on the same day that they cast their mailed ballot. Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  123 allowing SDR to citizens who became eligible to vote due to naturalization or who had their voting rights restored after a conviction or felony and only if they became eligib le between the close of books and Election Day. In 2020, 29 states reported allowing some form of SDR. Twenty one states reported allowing voters to register to vote on Election Day. Twelve states reported allowing SDR during an overlap between the start of early voting and the close of voter registration, 20 states reported allowing for SDR during in person early voting, and four states reported allowing for SDR in very specific cases.29 The states that indicated allowing SDR were mostly the same as in 2018, with the exception of South Carolina , which allowed SDR for the 2018 general election but not in 2020, and American Samoa, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Nevada, which did not allow for SDR in 2018 but did for the 2020 general election. 30 The total number of SDR s recorded in 2020 was 1,634,346 and accounted for 3.5 of the total registrations received among states allowing for SDR.31 For the first time, the 2020 EAVS asked states to break down SDRs between those that were received before and on Election Day. Election Day SDRs added up to 934,238 , and early voting SDR s summed to 665,10 8 registrations .32 There was a wide variability in how the two types of SDR s were distributed among states that reported both, with Election Day SDR s accounting for between 5.9 and 100 of the total SDR s that states reported.33 The use of SDR varied considerably, and similar to previous elections, the five NVRA exempt states  which gained NVRA exemption for allowing SDR continuously since 199434were among the states where SDR accounted for the largest percentages of registration applications. In Wyoming , 55.6 of the registration applications were SDR, followed by Idaho with 40.7 and Wisconsin with 30.4.35 The NVRA states where SDR accounted for the largest portions of their registration applications received were Vermont 24.4 and Maine 24. However, for most of the NVRA states, SDR accounted for less than 5 of registration applications. 29 These results were obtained from item Q9a of the 2020 Policy Survey . More information about state policies on SDR is found in Chapter 2 of this report. 30 These results were obtained from item Q9 of the 2020 Policy Survey and item Q7 of the 2018 Policy Survey. 31 The total number of SDR applications received during the two year period leading to a federal general election was reported in item A2a in the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of registrations received that were SDRs was calculated by dividing the number of SDRs received item A2a of the EAVS by the total number of regist ration applications received item A3a of the EAVS. The total and percentage correspond to the 26 states that reported allowing SDR and reported data for it. Guam and Massachusetts, which allow for some form of SDR, reported Data not available for this field. American Samoa reported zero total SDR s. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 32 The total number of Election Day SDR s was reported in item A2b in the 2020 EAVS, and the total number of early voting SDRs was reported in item A2c in the 2020 EAVS. The sum of Election Day SDR s and early voting SDR s does not add up to the total SDR s reported because some states either did not break down SDR by type Alaska or their submissions in A2b and A2c did not sum to A2a California, Illinois, and Utah. 33 The percentage of SDRs that were Election Day SDR s was calculated by dividing the number of Election Day SDR applications received item A2b of the EAVS by the total number of SDR applications received item A2a of the EAVS. 34 North Dakota is also NVRA exempt because it does not require voter registration, and the U.S. territories are also NVRA exempt. 35 The percentage of registration applications that were SDRs was calculated by dividing the number of SDR applications received item A2a of the EAVS by the total number of registration applications received item A3a of EAVS. 124  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond Automatic Voter Registration Beginning in 2016, states started implementing laws allowing for automatic voter registration AVR. These laws allow for non registered persons to be added to the voter registration rolls during or after an interaction with a designated state agency, such as the motor vehicle department, unless the person specifically declines to be registered. The most common differences between the types of AVR policies were the point at which the individual must decline or  opt out of being registered  either at the point of service or at a later time through a ma iler sent to the individual and which state agencies participate in the AVR program. In 2016, Oregon was the first state to implement AVR at the state level. Since then, 23 states have also started using some form of AVR.36 For the most part, states report ed that individuals must opt out of AVR at the point of service. A very common example is that a person is provided the opportunity to register to vote while completing a transaction at their local motor vehicle department and is asked to provide a respons e of yes or no to be able to continue with the voter registration transaction. Only the states of Colorado and Oregon reported not asking individual s during their transaction s and later requiring that they actively respond to a mailer if they do not wa nt to be included in the voter registration rolls. 37 All states that reported allowing AVR did so at least through the states motor vehicle department, with nine states reporting additional agencies e.g., agencies for people with disabilities, public assistance offices participating in the AVR program in their state. 38 The EAVS does not include any questions about the number of AVRs processed by states. However, the EAVS data show an increase in registrations submitted through motor vehicle department s which data from the 2020 Policy Survey show is the most common state agency that processes AVRs  between 2016 and 2020. Although the increase of 14.3 million voter registrations processed through the motor vehicle department in this time span is likely the result of multiple factors, AVR may be one of them. 39 When comparing the change in motor vehicle department registrations recorded between 2016 and 2020 among states with and without AVR, states with AVR reported an increase of 80  in the number of registrations received at the motor vehicle department, whereas states without AVR reported a 10.1  increase. 40 These increases may be , in part, driven by the fact that there was a 33.8 increase in the total number of registrations received between 2016 and 36 The number of states with AVR was obtained through item Q6 in the Policy Survey. More information about states with AVR is found in Chapter 2 of this report. 37 Information on the point at which the individual has the opportunity to opt out of AVR was obtained through item Q6b in the Policy Survey. 38 Information on state agencies participating in the AVR prog ram for each state was obtained through item Q6a in the Policy Survey. 39 Total registrations received at motor vehicle departments was obtained through items A4d in the 2020 EAVS and A6d in the 2016 EAVS. 40 The percentage change in total number of registrations received at the motor vehicle department between 2016 and 2020 was calculated by dividing the number of registration applications received at the motor vehicle department in 2020 item A4d of the 2020 EAVS by the number of registration applications received at the motor vehicle department in 2016 item A6d of the 2016 EAVS for states that did and did not allow for AVR as reported in item Q6 of the Policy Survey. Classification of states as having AVR and not having AVR used item Q6 of the 2020 Polic y Survey. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  125 2020.41 However, the trend of AVR states having an increase in motor vehicle department registration holds when comparing the percentage of registration applications received through motor vehicle departments in states with and without AVR for the 2016 and 2020 elections. Figure 3 shows that among states without AVR, motor vehicle department registrations accounted for a similar portion of the total registrations in 2016 and 2020 . There has been a notable increase among the states that have implemented AVR in recent years. Figure 3. Motor Vehicle Department Registrations Accounted for a Larger Portion of Total Registrations Received in AVR States Source The percentage of registrations received at motor vehicle departments was calculated as A4dA3a x 100 for the 2020 EAVS and A6dA5a x 100 for the 2016 EAVS. Classification of states as having AVR and not having AVR used item Q6 of the 2020 Policy Survey. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. Alaska is the only state that reported AVRs as a separate category in its EAVS data, as this state processes most of i ts AVRs through the Permanent Fund Dividend program. Alaska reported in its 41 The percentage change in the total number of registrations received between 2016 and 2020 was calculated by dividing the number of registration applications received in 2020 item A3a of the 2020 EAVS by the number of registration applications received in 2016 item A5a of the 2016 EAVS. North Dakota was not included in this calculation because i t does not have voter registration. American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands were not included in this calculation because they did not complete the 2016 EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 126  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond survey comments that in 2016, the state approved a ballot initiative requiring AVR through the Permanent Fund Dividend. Since the implementation of the initiative, the total number of registration applications that the state reported receiving increased from 259,227 in 2016 to 1,079,008 in 2020. 42 AVRs through the Permanent Fund Dividend program accounted for 68.1 of Alaskas total registrations in 2020 and 59.8 in 2018.43 Other Modes of Registration In addition to in person, online, mailfaxemail, and motor vehicle department registrations, states reported data on registration applications received from other sources, which in 2020 accounted for 12.9 of the applications received at the national level. 44 Some of these modes of registration are NVRA mandated, such as registrations through armed forces recruitment offices, public assistance offices , and state funded agencies serving persons with disabilities. These NVRA mandated modes of registration accounted for 1.8 of the national registrations in 2020.45 States also reported registrations completed through other modes that are not required by th e NVRA and that are authorized at the discretion of the state, such as at registration drives 2.2 and other agencies required by the state 3. 46 Voter Registration Rates for the 2020 General Election The NVRA requires each state to report its total nu mber of registered and eligible, active, and inactive registrants for each federal general election.47 Most states reported the total registered and eligible voters as the sum of active and inactive registrants. However, data on registered and eligible voters as reported in the EAVS should be used with caution, as these totals can include registrants who were no longer eligible to vote in that state but who had not been removed from the voter registration rolls because the removal process from the inactive list laid out by the NVRA can take up to two election cycles to be completed.48 In addition, preliminary data from the 2020 U.S. 42 The number of total registrations received was obtained from item A3a in the 2020 EAVS and from item A5a in the 2016 EAVS. 43 Alaska reported data on the number of registrations received through the Permanent Fund Dividend program in item A4j of the 2020 and 2018 EAVS. The percentage of the total registrations that were processed through the Permanent Fund Dividend program was c alculated by dividing the number of the program registration applications item A4j for Alaska in the 2020 and the 2018 EAVS by Alaskas total registrations received item A3a in the 2020 and the 2018 EAVS. 44 The percentage of registrations received by other sources different t han in person, online, mailfaxemail , and the motor vehicle department was calculated as A4eA4fA4gA4hA4iA4jA4kA4lA3a x 100 for the 2020 EAVS. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in these calculations. 45 The percentage of registrations received from NVRA mandated sources different than in person, mailfaxemail , and the motor vehicle department was calculated as A4eA4fA4gA3a x 100 for the 2020 EAVS . Casewise deletion was used at the state level in these calculations. 46 The percentage of registrations received from registration drives and from state agencies not mandated by the NVRA used items A4i and A4h of the 2020 EAVS, respectively, and were divided by the total number of registration applications received item A3a of the EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in these calculations. 47 Twelve states American Samoa, Guam, Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, the Northern Mariana Islands, Ohio, Oregon, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Wisconsin, and Wyoming reported only active registrants. North Dakota does not have voter registration and, thus, did not have any data to report. 48 California, Florida, Kansas, and New York reported more registered and eligible voters in their state than the sum of the active and inactive registrants, resulting in 13,704 13,384 11,199  and 776 uncateg orized registrants, respectively. New Hampshire reported zero registrations in 18 of its 320 jurisdictions. Two jurisdictions in Wisconsin reported zero registrations because they changed their status from town to village andor merged with other jurisdict ions where they reported the corresponding registration data. Kalawao County in Hawaii reported zero registrations because Maui County administers Kalawao Countys elections. Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  127 Census show that the U.S. population increased by more than 20 million people since the 2010 Census, resulting in a change of apportionment for congressional seats in 13 states49 this population increase and mobility may be a contributing factor to the in crease of records that states reported having on their voter registration rolls for the 2020 general election. For the 2020 general election, states reported that 228,004,364 citizens were registered to vote, either as active or inactive voters. 50 This represents a 6.5 increase compared to the number of people who were registered to vote for the 2016 general election.51 Nationally, 91.9 of all registrants were designated as active, and 9.1 of registrants were designated as inactive.52 In 2020, the total number of active registrants exceeded the 200 million mark for the first time in EAVS history and accounted for 88.2 of the 2019 citizen voting age population  CVAP.53 The number of active registrants in 2020 increased 8.3 compared to what states report ed for the 2016 EAVS. In 2020, the majority of states reported active registration rates of 80 or more of their 2019 CVAP see Table 1 in Appendix A of this chapter .54 Compared to the active registration rates in 2016, 82  of the states reported a higher active registration rate in 2020.55 49 U.S. Census Bureau. 2021, April 26 . First 2020 Census Data Release Shows U.S. Resident Population of 331,449,281 . httpswww.census.govlibrarystories2021042020 census datarelease.html . 50 The total number of registered voters was obtained from item A1a in the 2020 EAVS. 51 The percentage change in the total number of registered voters between 2016 and 2020 was calculated by dividing the total number of registered voters in 2020 item A1a of the 2020 EAVS by the total number of registered voters in 2016 item A1a of the 2016 EAVS. 52 The percentage of active and inactive registrants used items A1b and A1c , respectively, of the 2020 EAVS and divided these items by the total number of registered voters item A1a of the EAVS. North Da kota was not included in these calculations because it does not have voter registration. Guam, Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, the Northern Mariana Islands, Ohio, Oregon, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Wisconsin , and Wyoming were not included in the percentage of inactive voters because they did not provide data about inactive voters in item A1c of the 2020 EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in these calculations. The percentages of active and inactive registrants do not add to 100 because of the use of state casewise deletion to calculate percentages at the national level, as discussed in Chapter 5. 53 The total number of active registrants was obtained from item A1b in the 2020 EAVS. The active CVAP voter registration rate was calcu lated by dividing the number of active registrants item A1b in the 2020 EAVS by the estimated CVAP provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. North Dakota was not included in the calculation because it does not have voter registration. American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands were not included in the calculation because there is no CVAP information from the Census Bureau for these territories. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in these calculations. This report uses the 1 year American Community Survey ACS state CVAP estimate for 2019 instead of the 5 year estimate to ensure that the CVAP is as current as possible. The CVAP estimates for 2020 were not available by the time this report was finalized. In calculating the percentage change in the total number of active registrants from the 2016 EAVS to the 2020 EAVS, casewise deletion has been used at the state level. 54 The percentage of active CVAP voter registration was calculated by dividing the total active registrants item A1b in the 2020 EAVS by the total CVAP. 55 The percentage of active CVAP voter registration change was calculated as the 2020 percentage of acti ve CVAP voter registration A1bCVAP x 100 for the 2020 EAVS divided by the 2016 percentage of active CVAP voter registration A3aCVAP x 100 for the 2016 EAVS . One unit was subtracted from the result of the division , and the result was multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage change. North Dakota was not included because it does not have voter registration. Pennsylvania was not included because it did not report total active registrants in 2016 , as the state commented that it could not differentiate between active and inactive from our point in time snapshot of the voter registration numbers . The U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands , and the U.S. Virgin Islands were not included because the U.S. Census Bureau does not provide an estimate for their CVAP. 128  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond There was a 3.6 percentage point increase in the active registration rates at the national level from 84.6 in 2016 to 88.2 in 2020.56 At the state level, Georgia and Texas reported the largest 56 The percentage of active CVAP voter registration for 2020 was calculated as the total active voters A1b in the 2020 EAVS divided by the 2019 CVAP. The percentage of active CVAP voter registration for 2016 was ca lculated as the total active voters A3a in the 2016 EAVS divided by the 2015 CVAP. The percent age point change between the 2016 and 2020 active CVAP voter registration rates was calculated by subtracting the 2015 active CVAP voter registration percentage from the 2019 active CVAP voter registration percentage. Calculating Registration Rates Estimating the percentage of the population that is registered to vote for an election can be appr oached in different ways using a variety of metrics. There are multiple potential numerators and denominators that can be used. Registration Rate Numerator Total Registrants. The n umber of people that states repor ted as being registered and eligible to vote A1a in the EAVS. This total includes active and inactive registrants. This metric overrepresents of the actual number of registrants within a state, since some of the people included particularly inactive registrants may not be eligible to vote in that jurisdiction. Active Registrants. The n umber of people that states repor ted as being eligible to cast a ballot without the need to provide additional eligibility evidence at the polls A1b in the EAVS. This total excludes inactive registrants. Regist ration Rate Denominator Voting Age Population VAP. The e stimate of the number of persons ages 18 or older provided by the Census Bureau. Citizen Voting Age Population CVAP. The estimate of the number of American citizens ages 18 or older provided by the Census Bureau. This estimate is more accurate than the VAP in that it restricts the inclusion criteria to being a U.S. citizen, which is mandatory to vote. Voting Eligible Population VEP . The e stimate created by subtracting from the CVAP the citizens that are ineligible to vote e.g., persons with disqualifying felony convictions and persons who are in the military or citizens living overseas. This estimate is provided by the U.S. Elections Project and is available at the state level but not at the jurisdiction level like the VAP and the CVAP estimates. The combination of active registrants and the CVAP to calculate the registration rate in the EAVS provides a higher level of accuracy than using the total registrations andor the VAP to calculate the rate at the jurisdiction level when needed, as opposed to the use of the VEP. This calculation, however, has some limitations, such as the potential overrepresentation of total registrants in the active registrant list due to the challenges for states to keep voter registration rolls fully up to date. When analyzing EAVS data, the EAC recommends using the following method to calculate voter registration rates  1   100         See Chapter 2 of this report for a discussion of state policies on voter registration list maintenance. Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  129 increases in active registration rates between 2016 and 2020 24.5 and 18.8, respectively, and New York and Puerto Rico reported the largest drops in active registration ra tes 24.3 and 14.4, respectively.57 Figure 4 shows the change in the active CVAP voter registration rate among states from the 2016 general election to the 2020 general election. Figure 4. Most States Had an Increase in the Active CVAP Voter Registration Rate From 2016 to 2020 Source The percentage of active CVAP voter registration change was calculated as the 2020 percentage of active CVAP voter registration A1bCVAP x 100 for the 2020 EAVS divided by the 2016 percentage of active CVAP voter registration A3aCVAP x 100 for the 2016 EAVS . One unit was subtracted from the result of the division , and the result was multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage change. North Dakota does not have a change rate because it does not have voter registration. Pennsylvania does not have a change rate , because it did not report total active registrants in 2016 , as the state commented that they could not differentiate between active and inactive from our point in time snapshot of the voter registration nu mbers.  The U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands , and the U.S. Virgin Islands do not have a change rate because the U.S. Census Bureau does not provide an estimate for their CVAP. Cutoff points in the graph were selected to reflect states that decreased, that slightly increased , and that notably increased in terms of the active CVAP registration rate from 2016 to 2020. 57 New York reported an uncharacteristically high number of active and total registrations in the 2016 EAVS compared to the registrations reported in the general elections of 2014, 2018, and 2020, which led to the drop in active registrants noted in the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of active CVAP voter registration was calculated by dividing the total active registrants item A1b in the 2020 EAVS by the total CVA P. 130  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond Types of Registrations Received for the 2020 General Election When a person submits a registration form, it is processed by the state and can reach one of several outcomes. Valid a pplications from persons who are eligible and not already registered are considered new applications and are added to the voter registration rolls. Applications submitted by persons already registered to vote at the same address with the same name and personal information are considered duplicates. Applications from already registered persons wishing to change their name, party affiliation, or address are processed as updates to existing registrations. Applications that do not meet the requirements of eligibility are considered invalid or rejected. When allowed by state law, applications submitted by persons under 18 years old are processed as preregistrations so that they will be registered when they become of voting age . All registration forms received are processed and scrutinized by election officials to ensure that the information is correct, that only eligible voters are a dded to the registration rolls, and that duplicate registration records are not created. After the application s review by election officials and following the NVRAs guidelines, states must notify the applicant with the result of their application. For example, a successful application may be notified in the form of a registration card mailed to the applicant or a notice of rejection may be mailed to unsuccessful applicants. Valid Registrations Table 1 displays information on the result of the registration applications that were received by states. Of the more than 100 million registration applications received between the 2018 and the 2020 federal general elections, the most common type of registration was an update to an existing record that did not invol ve a cross jurisdiction change of address. 58 These updates usually involve a change of name such as after a marriage or divorce, party affiliation, or within jurisdiction change of address these update s accounted for 49.4 of the registrations processed at the national level.59 New valid registrations a registration application received from an eligible person in a jurisdiction where they were not previously registered and that resulted in a new registration record being added to the voter registration rollmade up 32.2 of the registrations received.60 Other types of valid registrations reported in the EAVS included a change of address that crossed local jurisdiction borders but was still within the state, which accounted for 9.5  of the total registration applications filed.61 Some states reported allowing for underage citizens to preregister to vote so that they are automatically added to the voter registration rolls when they turn 18 years old. 58 The number of total registration applications was reported in item A3a of the EAVS. The number of registration applications that were a change of name, party, or within jurisdiction change of address was reported in item A3f of the EAVS. 59 The percent age of registration applications that were a change of name, party, or within jurisdiction change of address received was calculated by dividing the number of such registration applications received item A3f of the EAVS by the total number of registratio n applications received item A3a of the EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 60 The percentage of registration applications that were a new registration was calculated by dividing the number of such registration applications received item A3b of the EAVS by the total number of registration applications received item A3a of the EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 61 The percentage of registration applications that were a cross jurisdiction change of address was calculated by dividing the number of such registration applications received item A3g of the EAVS by the total number of registration applications received item A3a of the EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state le vel was used in this calculation. Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  131 These preregistrations accounted for 1.2 of the total registrations among states that allowed them.62 Finally, 14.7 of the registrations were labelled as Other. This category in the EAVS is used by states to report registrations that were not covered among the standard categories, or in most cases, to report registrations that could not be broken down into the categories provided, such as a change to existing records that some jurisdictions could not determine whether it involved a within or cross jurisdictional change of address .63 Table 1. M ost Registration Applications Were New Applications or Within Jurisdiction Changes Type of Registration Form Received Percentage of Total Registration Forms Received Change of name, party, or address within jurisdiction 49.4 New valid registrations 32.2 Other 14.7 Duplicate registrations 9.7 Cross jurisdiction change of address 9.5 Invalid or rejected 2.9 Preregistrations from persons under 18 years of age 1.2 Source The percentage of registrations received that were a change of name, party, or within jurisdiction change of address received was calculated as A3fA3a x 100. The percentage of registrations received that were a new valid registration was calcula ted as A3bA3a x 100. The percentage of registrations received that were a duplicate registration was calculated as A3dA3a x 100. The percentage of registrations received that were a cross jurisdiction change of address was calculated as A3gA3a x 100. The percentage of registrations received that were labelled as  Other registrations was calculated as A3hA3iA3j A3a x 100. The percentage of registrations received that were i nvalid or a rejected registration was calculated as A3eA3a x 100. The percentage of registrations received that were a preregistration of persons under 18 years of age was calculated as A3cA3a x 100. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in these calculations percentages for each type of registration were calculated independently and only states that reported data for a given type were included in the analysis , and because of this , percentages do not sum to 100. Rejected and Duplicate Registrations Some of the registration forms received by states do not result in the creation or the update of a registration record. The two types of invalid registration applications that the EAVS collects data on are rejected applications and duplicate applications. The first group includes applications that contain incorrect information, information that cannot be validated against existing state records, or applications from persons who do not meet eligibility requirements. In the period between the close 62 The percentage of registration applications that were a preregistration of persons under 18 years of age was calculated by dividing the number of such registration applications received item A3c of the EAVS by the tota l number of registration applications received item A3a of the EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 63 The percentage of registration applications that were categorized as  other  was calculated by dividing the total number of such registration applications received sum of items A3h, A3i, and A3j of the EAVS by the total number of registration applications received item A3a of the EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. Not all the applications accounted for in the  other category may be valid  however, they were included in this section because they cannot be fully identified as rejected or duplicate either. 132  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond of registration for the 2018 general election and the close of registration for the 2020 general election, states reported rejecting 2,840,590 applications, accounting for 2.9 of the total registration applications received. This percentage is comparable to the percentage of registrations that were rejected in 2018 3.4 and 2016 3.2. 64 Dupli cate registrations include applications that are exact matches to existing registration records these can be applications submitted by persons who did not realize they were already registered to vote or who submitted multiple applications through different modes e.g., submitted an application with the exact same information through the mail and online. States reported receiving 8,827,089 duplicate applications between the 2018 and the 2020 federal general elections, which accounted for 9.7 of the total registrations received. 65 As with rejected applications, the percentage of duplicate registration s registered in 2020 was comparable to those in 2018 10.2 and 2016 7.9.66 A majority of states provided a breakdown of the total, rejected, and duplicate registrations they received and the source of those registrations e.g., mail, in person. 67 As expected, most registration sources had rejection and duplicate percentages that were similar to the national averages however, there were a few outliers. For duplicate registrations, the overall percentage at the national level was 9.7 , and most sources reported duplicate percentages similar to the national level , ranging from 5.3 to 13.3 . 68 However, there were exceptions, such as state designated offices not mandated by the NVRA, that reported lower levels of duplicate registrations  3. At the other side of the spectrum, registrations received by mail, fax , or email had notably higher levels of duplicate registrations received  19.1  compared to the national average .69 Invalid or rejected applications 64 The number of total registration application rejections was obtained from item A3e of the EAVS. The percentage of registrations received that were invalid or rejected registrations in 2020 was calculated as the total applications rejected in 2020 item A3e in the 2020 EAVS divided by the total registration applications received item A3a in the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of registrations received that were invalid or rejected registrations in 2018 was calculated as the total applications rejected in 2018 item A3e in the 2018 EAVS divided by the total registration applications received item A3a in the 2018 EAVS. The percentage of registrations received that were invalid or rejected registrations in 2016 was calculated as the total applications rejected in 2016 item A5e in the 2016 EAVS divided by the total regi stration applications received item A5a in the 2016 EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 65 The number of total duplicate registration applications was obtained from item A3d of the EAVS. The percentage of registrations received that were duplicate registrations in 2020 was calculated as the total duplicate applications in 2020 item A3d in the 2020 EAVS divided by the total registration applications received item A3a in the 2020 EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state l evel was used in this calculation. 66 The percentage of registrations received that were duplicate registrations in 2020 was calculated as the total duplicate applications in 2018 item A3d in the 2018 EAVS divided by the total registration applications received item A3a in the 2018 EAVS. The percentage of registrations received that were duplicate registrations in 2016 was calculated as the total duplicate applications in 2016 item A5d in the 2016 EAVS divided by the total registration applications received item A5a in the 2016 EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 67 Thirteen states did not provide the application source breakdown for duplicate registrations , and 14 states did not provide the application source breakdown for rejected registrations. Data from these states were not included in the ensuing calculations in the paragraph. 68 The percentage of registration applications received from a source and categorized as duplicate was calculated as follows for each registration source included in the range in person  A6bA4b x 100 online  A6cA4c x 100 motor vehicle department  A6dA4d x 100 public assistance offices  A6eA4e x 100 state funded agencies serving persons with disabilities  A6fA4f x 100 armed forces recruitment offices  A6gA4g x 100 registration drives  A6iA4i x 100 Other  A6jA6kA6lA4jA4kA4l x 100. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 69 The percentage of registration ap plications that were duplicates was calculated as follows for each registration source mentioned state designated offices not mandated by the NVRA  A6hA4h x 100 mailfaxemail  A6aA4a x 100. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this c alculation. Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  133 represented 2.9 of registrations at the national level, and most sources reported a rejection percentage close to that, ranging from 1. 7 to 4.2 of registrations rejected,70 except for registration drives 10.1, and NVRA mandated public assistance offices 9.1 that had notably higher levels of applications classified as rejected or invalid.71 Registration List Maintenance The NVRA requires states to maintain an accurate and current voter registration roll to protect the integrity of the electoral process.72 To facilitate this maintenance, the NVRA requires that any change of address submitted to a motor vehicle department must serve as notification of a change of address for voter registration, unless the individual indicates that the change is not for voter registration purposes. The law also requires states and territories to conduct a uniform and nondiscriminatory general program to remove the records of ineligible voters. State s and territories have considerable freedom to choose when, where, and how these functions are performed, but must follow the guidelines listed in the NVRA, which describe the need to use confirmation notices and to complete with few exceptions systemati c removal programs not later than 90 days prior to the date of a primary or general election for Federal office , 73 as well as to keep a detailed list of instances in which it is appropriate to remove a record from the voter registration rolls. Confirmati on Notices One tool that states may use to keep their voter registration rolls up to date are confirmation notices. These are postage pre paid and pre addressed return cards that are sent to registrants who a state suspects are no longer eligible to vote in the jurisdiction in which they are registered . If the registrant does not return the confirmation notice, they can be added to the inactive registrant list and would be asked to provide proof of residence before voting. If the registrant fails to return the confirmation notice and does not participate in the subsequent two consecutive federal elections, then the NVRA grants the state the ability to remove the registrant from the voter registration roll. If the registrant has not moved out of the voting jurisdiction, they must complete and return the confirmation notice no later than the registration deadline of the next election to remain o n the list of active registrants. 70 The percentage of registration applications received from a source and categorized as invalid or rejected was calculated as follows for each registration source included in the range mailfaxemail  A7aA4a x 100 in person  A7bA4b x 100 online  A7cA4c x 100 motor vehicle department  A7dA4d x 100 state funded agencies serving persons with disabilities  A7fA4f x 100 armed forces recruitment offices  A7gA4g x 100 state designated offices not mandated by the NVRA  A 7hA4h x 100 and Other  A7jA7kA7lA4jA4kA4l x 100. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 71 The percentage of registration applications received from a source and categorized as invalid or rejected was calculated as follows for each registration source mentioned registration drives  A7iA4i x 100 public assistance offices  A7eA4e x 100. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 72 52 U.S.C.  20501 73 52 U.S.C.  20507 134  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond Figure 5. Almost Two Thirds of Confirmation Notices That Were Sent Had an Unknown Status Source Status unknown A8e refers to any notice that was sent to a voter but was not received back confirming registration, confirming invalidation, or returned as undeliverable. This percent age was calculated as A8eA8a x 100. The percentage of confirmation notices sent and returned confirming valid registration was calculated as A8bA8a x 100. The percentage of confirmation notices sent and returned undeliverable was calculated as A8dA8a x 100. The percentage of confirmation notices sent and returned confirming registration should be invalidated was calculated as A8cA8a x 100. The percentage of confirmation notices sent and not categorized was calculated as 1  A8bA8cA8dA8eA8fA8g A8hA8a x 100. The percentage of confirmation notices sent and labeled as other was calculated as A8fA8gA8hA8a x 100. Casewise deletion was used at the state level percentages for each category were calculated independently and only states that reported data for a given category were included in the analysis, and because of this , percentages do not sum to 100. Nationa lly, 28,010,094 confirmation notices were sent between the 2018 general election and the month before the 2020 general election, accounting for 14.3 of the active voters reported by states in 2020.74 This percentage is slightly higher than what was reported by states in 2018 74 The total number of confirmation notices sent was reported in item A8a of the EAVS. The number of confirmation notices sent as a percentage of the active registrants was calculated using total confirmation notices sent item A8a of the EAVS divided by total active registrants A1b of the EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. In 2020, 49 states and territories reported the number of confirmation notices sent during the period of registration for the 2020 general election. North Dakota does not require citizens to register to vote and , thus, does not use confirmation notices. Minnesota, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands , and Wyoming are NVRA exempt. Alabama reported that they did not have a report that has the total number of confirmation notices sent. Indiana did not provide this information Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  135 11.6 and in 2016 10.9 .75 Figure 5 shows that confirmation notices with an unknown status accounted for 65.8 of the total. The unknown status notices generally included confirmation notices that were sent and never returned to the jurisdiction allowing states to move the addresse es of these notices to the inactive registration list if the state uses that designation. States reported 12.1 of confirmation notices were returned confirming the voters continued eligibility, and 8.1 were returned confirming the voter was no longer eligible to vote in the jurisdiction or no longer wanted to be registered to vote. Removing Voters From Voter Registration Rolls The NVRA mandates that registrants may only be removed from the voter registration rolls in these circumstances Upon the death of the registrant Upon the registrants written confirmation that their address has changed to a location outside the registrars jurisdiction On the request of the registrant For mental incapacity of the registrant, as provided in state law On criminal conviction of the registrant, as provided in state law or On the registrants failure to respond to certain confirmation mailings along with failur e to appear to vote in two consecutive federal general elections subsequent to the mailing. Because some of the states processes to remove a registrant from the voter registration rolls can take up to two federal general election cycles to complete , it is inevitable that voter registration rolls will contain some number of voter records for individuals who are no longer eligible to vote. Between the close of registration for the 201 8 general election and the close of registration for the 2020 general election, states reported removing 18, 781,054 records from their voter registration rolls.76 This was equal to 8.2 of the total number of voters who were registered in the United States as of the close of registration for the 2020 general election.77 Almost two third s of the states and territories reported removing a number of registrants that added up to between 3 and 10 of their total registered voters. There were some exceptions to this trend  Connecticuts removals accounted because it does not send the removal notices referenced by the EAC su rvey. Forty four states reported the status of the confirmation notices sent. In addition to the states that did not report on confirmation notices, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island did not break down the number of confirmation notices sent by status. 75 The number of confirmation notices sent as a percentage of the active registrants in 2018 was calculated using total confirmation notices sent item A8a of the 2018 EAVS divided by total active registrants A1b of the 2018 EAVS. The number of confirmation notices sent as a percentage of the active registrants in 2016 was calculated using total confirmation notices sent item A10a of the 2016 EAVS divided by total active registrants A3a of the 2016 EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 76 The total number of registrants removed from the voter registration rolls was reported in item A9a of the EAVS. All states and territories reported data for the items related to voter removal, except for North Dakota, which does not require citizens to register to vote. 77 The number of registrants removed as a percentage of total registrants was calculated using total registrants removed from the voter registration rolls item A9a of the EAVS divided by total registrants A1a of the EAVS. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in this calculation. 136  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond for the lowest percentage of total registrants at 2.1, and Puerto Rico reported the highest percentage of removals at 32.3 see Table 5 of Appendix A in this chapter . States also reported the reasons for removing records from their voter registration rolls. These reasons for removal are shown in Figure 6. The most common reason was failure to both respond to a confirmation notice and to vote in two consecutive federal general elections, which accounted for 32.1 of removals. Crossjurisdiction change of address and death of the registrant were the other two major reasons for states  removal of registrants from their rolls 28. 5 and 21. 4, respectively. Figure 6. Almost OneThird of Removed Registration Records Were a Result of Failure to Respond to a Confirmation Notice Source The percentage of registrations removed because of no response to confirmation notices and not voting in the following two general elections was calculated as A9eA9a x 100. The percentage of registrations removed because of a cross jurisdiction change of address was calculated as A9bA9a x 100. The percentage of registrations removed because of death was calculated as A9cA9a x 100. The percentage of registrations removed because the voter was declared mentally incompetent or because of other reasons was calculated as A9fA9hA9iA9jA9a x 100. The percentage of registrations removed because the voter requested to be removed was calculated as A9gA9a x 100. The percentage of registrations removed because of disqualifying felony conviction was calculated as A9dA9a x 100. Casewise deletion was used at the state level percentages for each category were calculated independently and only states that reported data for a given category were included in the analysis , and because of this , percentages do not sum to 100. Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  137 The majority of states reported that a registrant could be removed from the voter registration rolls if the registrant received a disqualifying criminal conviction andor was incarcerated,78 but only 1.6  of the removals were the result of a disqualifying felony conviction.79 Two states, however, reported that more than 10  of their registration removals happened due to criminal convictions or incarceration.

The 2020 data uses the 2019 CVAP, the 2018 data uses the 2017 CVAP, and the 2016 data uses the 2015 CVAP . Reported Registrations uses question A1a for 2020, 2018, and 2016. Active Registrations uses question A1b for 2020 and 2018 and question A3a for 2016. Active Registrations   of CVAP uses question A1b divided by CVAP for 2020 and 2018 and question A3a divided by CVAP for 2016 . Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  143 Active Registrations   of Total uses question A1b divided by A1a for 2020 and 2018 and question A3a divided by A1a for 2016 . Inactive Registrations uses question A1c for 2020 and 2018 and question A3b for 2016. Inactive Registrations   of Total uses question A1c divided by question A1a for 2020 and 2018 and question A3b divided by question A1a for 2016 . Voter Regi stration Table 1 Data Notes  General Notes Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating national percentages. The percentage calculations at the national level U.S. Total only used data from those states that provided data for the numerator and denominator of the calculation. Because each percentage was calcu lated independently, the active registration  of total  and inactive registration  of total  rates may not sum to 100 for some states or at the national level. The citizen voting age population CVAP is an estimate of the number of U.S. citizens ages 18 years or older in the state. This report uses the 1 year American Community Survey ACS state estimate for 2019 instead of the 5 year estimate to ensure that the CVAP was as current as possible. The estimate for the year 2020 was not available by the time this report was finalized. The 2019 1 year CVAP does not include data that were collected as part of the decennial Census conducted in 2020 . For consistency, the CVAP for the 2018 and 2016 general elections was the 1year ACS state estimate for 2017 and 2015, respectively. Some states may report an active CVAP registration rate of 100 or more. This is because the2019 CVAP was used to calculate the 2020 registration rate and because due to federal law,some ineligible voters may take up to two full election cycles to be removed from the voter registration rolls. The Reported Registrations column includes both active and inactive voters if the state uses such a distinction. 1The U.S. Census Bureau does not calculate a CVAP for the territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Nort he rn Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 2American Samoa, Guam, Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, the North e rn Mariana Islands, Ohio, Oregon, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Wisconsin, and Wyoming reported having only active registered voters. 3American Samoa did not provide data for the 2016 EAVS. 4California adjusted their number of total reg istrat io ns A1a in 2018 after the data were initially released , so the total in this table does not match the total reported in the 2018 EAVS Comprehensive Report . California reported 63,659 fewer registrants in Riverside County in their correction of the 2018 EAVS data. 5Kentucky reported having only active voters in the 2016 EAVS and reported having zero inactive voters in the 20 18 EAVS. 6Maryland reported having only active voters in the 2016 and the 2018 EA V S. 7Michigan noted in a survey comment that V oters r ep orted in A 1 are eligible to vote. Those defined as inactive  need only to confirm their address before receiving a ballot. Participation in past elections is not a factor in defining eligibility.  8Minnesota noted in a survey comment that M inn es ota is NVRA exempt. Minnesota does not classify voters as inactive per NVRA.144  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond 9Montana noted in a survey comment that in A1a, the total registeredeligible voters consists of active and inact ive. Montana reports total registeredeligible voters of 752,538. The difference is provisional, late registration and pending.  10 Nebraska noted in a survey comment that the state  does n ot have inactive  voters. The numbers in line A1c reflect the number of voters who were sent a section 8d2 notice and have not responded.  11 New Hampshire began a ri gorous 10year verification of the checklist beginning April 1, 2021. 12 New Mexicos 2018 EAV S data on the number of active registration s contained an error the correct number is 1,261,532. 13 New York reported having only active voters in the 2016 EAVS. This state also report ed an uncharacteristically high number of active and total registrations in the 2016 EAVS compared to the registrations reported in the general elections of 2014, 2018, and 2020. 14 North Dakota does not have voter registration and does not provide data in Section A of the EAVS. 15 Th e Northern Mariana Islands did not participate in the 2016 or the 2018 EAVS. For 2020, the Northern Mariana Islands reported in a comment in A1 that Voters are taken out of the roster once inactive as per our Election Statute.  16 Ohio reported Data not available for the number of inactive registrations in item A1c in 2020. The state di d n ot report inactive registrations in 2018 and 2016. 17 Oregon noted in a survey comment that they  do not t r ack number of inactive voters.  18 Pennsylvania reporte d in the 2016 EAVS that the state could not differentiate between active and inactive from our point in time snapshot of the voter registration numbers. 19 Puerto Rico did not participate in the 2018 EAVS be c ause the territory did not hold federal elections in that year. 20 Wisconsin is exempt from the NVRA and does not classify inactive voters per NVRA definitions.Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  145 Voter

Vote r Registration Table 2 Data Notes  General Notes Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating national percentages. The percentage calculations at the national level U.S. Total only used data from those states that provided data for the numerator and denominator of the calculation. States have latitude in which registration application sources are offered to their citizens, so long as they do not conflict with federal law. Not all states offer each of the application sources that the EAVS collects data for. Questions A4j, A4k, and A4l were not mandatory. States and jurisdictions only reported data in these items if they offered another application source aside from those listed in questions A4aA4i or if there were registration applications that could not be categorized in questions A4a A4i. Negative numbers in the N ot Categorized application source indicate that the sum of registrations received for each source account for more than the total number of registrations reportedreceived by the state. Because each percentage was calculated independently, the percentage of applications received through each source may not sum to 100 for some states or at the national level. 1Alabama noted in a survey comment that the states A3a data come from an Ele ction Systems  Software  ESS  election survey. In addition, unknown applications sources were not identified. 2Georgia noted in a survey comment that E lec tion Day registrations listed in A4j, A5j, A6j, and A 7j represent applications submitted to poll workers on E lection Day. Georgia law does not allow same day regis tration. Changes made through applications turned in on Election Day are effective for future elections.  3Idaho noted in survey comments for multiple counties that the state switched to a new voter regis tration system between the 2018 and the 2020 elections, which made it difficult to track some data for these questions. 4Indiana noted in survey comments th at Th e data reported in A4a l consists of data from county surveys  A4a b, A4i and SVRS statewide voter registration system A4c h, A4j, A4k, A4l. Counties do not always manually track the information requested in A4a b and A 4i and therefore arent in cluded in the sums that should match up to A3a. 5Kentucky noted in a survey comment that  Driv es by advocacy groups or political parties  is used for high school registrations.  6Louisiana noted in a survey comment that  Vo ters submit registration applications for new registrations as well as for updates or changes to existing registrations. A4 totals reflect both new registrations and changes to registrations.  7Michigan noted in a survey comment that  202 0 is the first EAVS since M ichigan implemented automatic voter registration and online voter registration, and became a member state of ERC sic, likely referring to the Electronic Registration Information Center . 8Montana noted in a survey comment that in A4k, online preregistration indicated that a voter still nee ded to sign and submit a registration form to the county elections office. 9Nebraska noted in survey comments that  On line registrations via DMV website are currently in the DMV section unable to split. Registrations received from drives by advocacy groups or political parties A4i are not separately categorized and are included in A4a.152  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond 10 New Hampshire noted in survey comments that it is not subject to the NVRA and does not h ave online voter registration. 11 New York noted in survey comments that  NYS DM V New York State Department of Motor Vehicles does allow voters to submit their registration data online, however it does not automatically register voters. After submittal to the DMV , the information is forwarded to the appropriate county board of elections to approve or deny the voter registration data. NYS BOE New York State Board of Elections used the term does not apply instead of  data not available  since online v oter registration has been passed as law, but the statewide system was not available for the 2020 election year.  12 North Dakota does not have voter registration and does not provide data in Section A of EAVS. 13 Rhode Island reported data not availab le for all modes of registration. The state noted in a survey comment that  Data for this section is unavailable. We rolled out a new voter registration system in December, 2019 so half of the voter registration records were processed in the old system and half in the new system.  14 Tennessee noted in survey comments that, for most of its counties, Data for agencies serving persons with disabilities in A4 f is included with data for public assistance offices in A4e. 15 Wisconsin is exe mpt from the NVRA and does not classify inactive voters per NVRA definitions, receive registrations from NVRA agencies, or collect data on rejected registrations.Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond  153 Voter

Voter Registration Table 3 Data Notes  General Notes Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating national percentages. The percentage calculations at the national level U.S. Total only used data from those states that provided data for the numerator and denominator of the calculation. Questions A3h, A3i, and A3j were not mandatory. States and jurisdictions only reported data in these items if there was another registration category aside from those listed in questions A3b  A3g or if there were registration applications that could not be categorized in questions A3b A3g. Negative numbers in the Not Categorized registration category indicate that the sum of registrations received for each category account for more than the total number of registrationsreported received by the state. Because each percentage was calculated independently, the percentage of applications in each category may not sum to 100 for some states or at the national level. Not all states track data to be able to provide responses for each registration category. 1Alabama noted in a survey comment that  Totals are from ESS Election Systems  Software election survey. A 3c we do not have pre registration. A3f due to the way we track data for changes to records, the number of changes resulting directly from registration forms could not be separated from the total numberof changes made to voters records.  2Colorado noted in a survey comment that  The inc rease in registrations is attributable to multiple factors. Colorado has seen a significant increase in population since 2016. The st ate conducted three elections in 2020, including the first presidential primary in 20 years. In addition, record turnout for theNovember 2020 general election contributed to the increased number of registrations. Another factor adding to the increase is t he implementation of automatic voter registration in May 2020 in partnership with the Colorado Department of Revenue CDOR. Automatic update to voter registration through CDOR was also implemented in 2019. This may also contribute to a somewhat inflated number as the addition ofa ZIP4 is counted as an update. Finally, with changes in personnel and as different perspectives are applied to data, queries tend to shift in an effort to obtain more accurate and inclusive data for reporting purposes.  3Connecticut noted in a survey comment that the d ata necessary to respond to question A3 is not retained in the system.  4The District of Columbia noted in a survey comment that A 3b a nd A3c preregistrations under 18, who turned 18 are total new registrations . 5Idaho noted in survey comments for multiple counties that the state switched to a new voter regis t ration system between the 2018 and the 2020 elections, which made it difficult to track some data for these questions. 6Iowa noted in a survey comment that  All other sources category is due to limitation on system to report transaction source of update if it is not a change from previous listed source.  7Louisiana noted in a survey comment that  Addres s changes across jurisdictions are counted as new registrations. 16  and 17 yearold citizens can apply to register to vote, but cannot vote until they are 18.  8Maryland noted in a survey comment that  The to tal of A 3a is the sum of A3b, A3c, A3d, and A3e. Maryland does not consider the registration changes listed in A 3f and A3g as registrations, and therefore ,158  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond the source of these changes is not recorded. For A3c, individuals can register to vote starting at age 16, however they are not considered preregistered. 16 and 17 yearolds are considered registered voters, they just cannot vote until their 18th birthday.  9Mississippi noted in survey comments that duplicate and rejected registrations are not tracked. 10 Missouri noted in a survey comment that  Cha nges of names and address report as separate transactions. In addition to that anytime the LEA local election administrator does an address library cleanup process or any change to the voting record it will record as an address change but may not be indicated by the voter. Therefore, we are not including the registration forms for change of name andaddress is sic the total for this section.  11 Nebraska noted in a survey comment that Nebraska law does not allow for pre regi strations for people not of voting age.  12 New Hampshire noted in survey comments that NH uses voter registration forms for name, party, and a ddress changes. 13 New Mexico noted that t he da t a for these items are not consistently captured across counties at this time. The Secretary of State s office is exploring options to capture and include this information in future reports. 14 North Dakota does not have voter registration and does not provide data in Section A of the EAVS . 1 5In Oregon, the n umber of cross jurisdiction address changes is included in the number of overall changes to registrations . The state does not track the number of invalidrejected registrations. 16 South Carolina noted in survey comments that for the states A3d and A3e responses, SC has no p rocess to collect data on duplicate registrations or r ejected registrations . 17 The U.S. Virgin Islands noted in survey comments that  A3c th e data was not tracked. A3d before any individual is registered to vote, the individuals information is checked in the system to ensure the individual was not previously registered. A3e a voter will not be registered to vote unless the individual provides the requir ed information birth paper, U.S. passport, etc.. Before the process begins, the prospective voter is informed what document and information is required to begin the process.  18 Washington noted in survey comments that the data reported in this questio n co vered the period between 20181008 and 2020 1103. 19 West Virginia noted in survey comments that  Dup licate registrations are based on DMV and online registrations . 20 Wisconsin is exempt from the NVRA and does not classify inactive voters per NVRA definitions. 21 Wyoming noted in survey comments that  Mu lt iple changes may have occurred on the same form. A3a includes a total, but the total could be less. For example, a voter could have submitted one form tochange their party and address. The data currently reflects that change as 2 forms. A3g. Counties do not receive forms for out ofcounty address changes. Those numbers are reflected in new jurisdictions as new registrations.

Not all states track data to be able to provide responses for each confirmation notice category. States that are exempt from the NVRA are not required to send confirmation notices pursuant to the NVRA, although they may send confirmation notices or other similar notices pursuant to state law or practice. States that do not use confirmation notices typically use other sources of data to identify potentially ineligible voters. 1Alabama noted in a survey comment that  We do not have a report that has the total number of confirmation notices sent.  Because Alabama does not report the total number of confirmation notices sent, the number of Not Categorized confirmation notices cannot be calculated. For the same reason, their responses were not included when calculating th e total Not Categorized confirmation notices at the national level. 2California has increased list maintenance training statewide to all county elections officials, including train ing regarding when to send confirmation notices per the NVRA and updated California state law. 3Delaware noted in a survey comment that I n 2 019, the state of DE changed voter registration vendors  from an in house mainfram e system to a cloud based provider.

Vote r Registration Table 5 Data Notes  General Notes Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating national percentages. The percentage calculations at the national level U.S. Total only used data from those states that provided data for the numerator and denominator of the calculation. Questions A9h, A9i, and A9g were not mandatory. States and jurisdictions only reported data in these items if there was another reason for registration removals aside from those listed in questions A9b A9g or if there were registration removals that could not be categorized in questi ons A9b A9e. Negative numbers in the Not Categorized registration removals category indicate that the sum ofregistration removals for each category account for more than the total number of registrationremovals reported received by the state. Because each percentage was calculated independently, the percentage of confirmation notices in each category may not sum to 100 for some states or at the national level. Not all states track data to be able to provide responses for each registration removal categor y. In addition, not all states may remove registrations for the listed reason. 1California has increased list maintenance training statewide to all county elections officials, including train ing regarding removal actions per the NVRA and updated California state law . 2Georgia noted in a survey comment that  A9b represents voters who moved out of the state. 3Indiana noted in a survey comment that  The da ta reported in A9bj consists of data from the ad hoc report A9b d, A9g j and SVRS statewide voter registration system A9e. Indiana provided the number of voter records cancelled due to being in inactive status for more than 2 federal general elections forquestion A9e. These statistics represent the majority of cancellations for this reason, based on the county user selecting the option to run this process in batch. However, county users have the option to alsocancel voters one byone for this reason, but those statistics are not included in the counts for question A9e. 4Louisi ana noted in a survey comment that  Ir regularities include voters that were cancelled by the registrar of voters because the registrant provided insufficient or incorrect data, or user processing error.Challenge 21 includes voters who were registered in another state or not a United States citizen, or were otherwise not qualified to be registered for reasons other than change of residence.  5Michigan noted in a survey comment that A9d in MI, registered voters cannot cast a ballot while they are incarcerated serving sentence however, their registration is never cancelled. Felony convictions alone do not disqualify voters from casting a ballot.  6Minnesota noted in a survey comment that A9d and A9f voter is not removed but status changes to challenged.

The cancellation option is no longer available to county officials. 170  Voter Registration The NVRA and Beyond 11 South Carolina reported in a survey comment that  A9 f it is rare for voters to be removed for this reason and would be included under other  A9h. 12 The U.S. Virgin Islands reported in a survey comment that the territory no longer purges voters who di d not vote in the past two general election. A voter can only be removed off the voting roll due to their death, request to be removed or move out of territory, or convicted of a felony. The voter will be reinstated once they serve their sentence. ESVI Election System of the Virgin Islands is plannin g to do more outreach to voters including notifying voters of voting centers, their respective voting centers, voter registration status to name a few.  13 Wisconsin is exempt from the NVRA and does not classify inactive voters per NVRA definitions. Only ac tive voters are registered and eligible to vote in Wisconsin. Wisconsins registered voters count for this report includes military voters, even though they are not required to register in Wisconsin. Wisconsin requires voters to re register each time their address changes. For the purposes of this report, voters are only counted as being removed from the voter rolls if they did not re register at a new address. Even voters who move within the same jurisdiction must re register in Wisconsin therefore, Wisconsin does not track these voters separately.Military and Overseas Voting in 2020  171 Chapter 4. Military and Overseas Voting in 20 20 UOCAVA Key Findings The Election Administration and Voting Survey  EAVS  Section B collected data from states and municipalities on individuals covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act UOCAVA during the 20 20 federal general election. Election officials were asked a variety of questions relating to UOCAVA voting practices, including the total number of registered UOCAVA voters, the use of the Federal Post Card Application FPCA, the quantity and method of ballots transmitted to and returned by UOCAVA voters, and the use of the Federal Write In Absentee Ballot FWAB.1 Among the results of this section, notable findings include Just over 40 of registered UOCAVA voters held legal voting residence in three states California, Florida, and Washington. Continuing a trend that began with the 2016 EAVS, overseas citizens ma de up a larger percentage of registered UOCAVA voters than did members of the uniformed services. More than 1.2 million ballots were transmitted to UOCAVA voters by election offices. More than 900,000 of these ballots were returned by UOCAVA voters and were submitted for counting. UOCAVA voters increasingly used electronic methods to receive and return their absentee ballots, but rates differed by UOCAVA voter type, with more overseas citizens using el ectronic options than uniformed services members, who continue to rely primarily on postal mail. The most common reason for UOCAVA ballot rejection was that the ballot was received after a states UOCAVA absentee ballot receipt deadline. FWAB usage continu ed to increase in 2020, with more UOCAVA voters using this backup ballot to cast their vote than in previous election cycles. Introduction The U.S. Election Assistance Commission EAC is required by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 HAVA to collect data from states2 and to report on absentee voting by uniformed services members and overseas citizens .3 Since 2014, the EAC has fulfilled this reporting mandate in partnership with the Federal Voting Assistance Program FVAP, the agency designated to administer UOCAVA on 1 The response rate among local jurisdictions for EAVS Section B was 99.9 five counties in Arkansas did not provide Section B data. In addition, the response rate for individual items varie d. Results reported in this chapter include only states for which d ata are available for a given question. State and national totals include all available jurisdictionlevel data. National level percentages reported in this chapter us ed casewise deletion. 2 Throughout this report, unless otherwise specified, the term state can be understood to apply to the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that submit Election Administration Policy Survey and EAVS data. 3 The Help America Vote Act of 2002 HAVA, 52 U.S.C.  20901. The EAC works with FVAP to collect comprehensive data from the states on all of the ballots sent and received by voters covered under UOCAVA 52 U.S.C.  20301b11. 172  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense  DOD. Through a memorandum of understanding between the EAC and FVAP, Section B of the EAVS is administered on behalf of both agencies. This agreement allows both the EAC and FVAP to fulfill congressionally mandated requirements to study UOCAVA voting while reducing the data collection and reporting burden on state and local election officials. States are required to report certain election data to the EAC after each federal election. 4 This chapter examines UOCAVA data from the 2020 EAVS, including use of the FPCA by UOCAVA voters, ballots transmitted to UOCAVA voters by states, ballots returned by UOCAVA voters, UOCAVA ballots counted, UOCAVA ballots rejected, and usage of the FWAB by UOCAVA voters. Where appropriate, information about state laws and procedures related to UOCAVA voting, collected as part of the EACs 2020 Election Administration Policy Survey Policy Survey , is presented to provide context for the EAVS results. Federal Laws Regulating Military and Overseas Voting The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986  UOCAVA  UOCAVA protects the voting rights of members of the uniformed services who are stationed away from their voting residence, the spouses and othe r eligible family of uniformed services members, and U.S. citizens residing outside of the United States. It requires all states, territories, and the District of Columbia to allow these citizens to register to vote and to cast an absentee ballot for all federal elections. 5 For the estimated 1.4 million uniformed services members and approximately 600,000 military spouses and voting age dependents stationed away from their legal voting residence 6 as well as the estimated 2.9 million voting age U.S. citize ns who live, study, or work overseas,7 the absentee voting process is different from and can be more challenging than the voting process for nonmilitary voters residing in the United States . 4 Section 703a HAVA amended section 102 of UOCAVA. 5 Throughout this report, the term uniformed services voter refers to U.S. citizens who are active members of the uniformed services or a spouse or dependent family member thereof. Overseas citizen  refers to non military U.S. citizens who reside overseas. 6 Information was provided by FVAP to Fors Marsh Group via email on May 10, 2021 , and was current as of March 31, 2021. 7 Federal Voting Assistance Program, 2018 Overseas Citizen Population Analysis, at httpswww.fvap.govinforeports  surveysoverseas citizen population analysis .

Citizens protected by UOCAVA include Members of the uniformed services Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps who are stationed away from their legal voting residence Members of the U.S. Merchant Marine Eligible family members of the above and U.S. citizens residing outside the United States.Military and Overseas Voting in 2020  173 Among the challenges UOCAVA sought to address was the wide variability in rules and procedures governing registration and voting across states, which made it difficult for uniformed services members and overseas citizens to navigate the voting process.8 UOCAVA established the FPCA, which serves as a combination registration and ballot request application that is accepted in all U.S. states and territories. In addition, the FWAB functions as a backup ballot that can be cast by UOCAVA voters who make a timely request for, but do not r eceive, a regular absentee ballot. 9 Although states and localities still maintain and administer elections according to their own laws and procedures for registration and absentee voting among uniformed services members and overseas citizens , the provisions of UOCAVA established some uniformity in the absentee voting process for these voters . The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act of 2009 MOVE Historically, UOCAVA ballots were transmitted from election offices to voters primarily t hrough the mail. Given long mailing times and high mobility rates for this population of voters, this practice meant that many UOCAVA voters were unable to receive and return their absentee ballot before state ballot return deadlines. The MOVE Act amended UOCAVA to establish additional requirements to protect military and overseas citizens voting rights. 10 These new rules required that all states and territories provide UOCAVA voters with an option to request and receive registration and absentee ballot request materials electronically, directed states to establish an electronic means of transmitting blank ballots to UOCAVA voters, and required states to provide free access to a system whereby voters can verify the status of their ballot . Additionally, absentee ballots must be transmitted no less than 45 days before a federal election to all UOCAVA voters who submit an absentee ballot request before this deadline. These additional provisions aimed to ensure uniformed services members and overseas citizens not only have the right to vote, but that they have sufficient time to receive and return their absentee ballots ahead of state deadlines. The UOCAVA Voting Process Although the specific path may differ depending on the policies and procedures in ones state of voting residence and on a voters particular situation and preferences, in general, the UOCAVA voting process can be summarized in six basic steps, as illustrated in Figure 1. 11 1.Register and request an absentee ballot  UO CAVA eligible citizens can do t his either by completing a state application form or an FPCA, the federal form that functions as both a registration and absentee ballot request and is accepted in all states and U.S. territories. 2.Submit th e registration and ballot request Completed applications must be submitted to the appropriate state or local election office by mail or by an electronic means permitted by the 8 The United States Department of Justic e. 2020, February 18.

For more detailed information about state policies related to UOCAVA voting, see Chapter 2 of this report. 174  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 Figure 1. The UOCAVA Voting Process stat e. All states accept FPCAs by mail  states may also accept FPCAs via email, fax, the states online voter registration portal, or by another mode. 3.A pplication processing  Once received, registration and absentee ballot request applications are processed by the election office. If an applicat ion fails to meet any state requirements e.g., the form is not completed correctly, is submitted after the registration deadline, or the applicant is deemed ineligible, then it may be rejected. If an application meets allrequirements and is accepted, it remains valid as a registration and ballot request, meaning that the voter will retain UOCAVA status and have an absentee ballot transmitted to them forthe duration specified by state policy. 4.B allot transmission  Election officials transmit absentee ballots to registered UOCAVA voters no later than 45 days before a federal election ballots may be transmitted later if the ballotrequest is submitted by the state deadline but less than 45 days before an election. Ballots Military and Overseas Voting in 2020  175 may be transmitted to a voter by m ail or through some other state approved electronic means of transmission, as requested by the voter. 5.Complete and return absentee ballot  UOCAVA voters complete and return their absentee ballot to the appropriate election office for processing. Ballots ma y be returned and submitted for processing either by mail or through some other means allowed by a state. The FWAB may be used as a backup ballot by UOCAVA voters who do not receive a regularabsentee ballot, or if the ballot does not arrive in time to be completed and returned aheadof state deadlines. 6.Ballot processing and counting Completed absentee ballots that are returned and submitted for counting to an election office must be received by state deadlines and meet other staterequirements. State poli cies on when completed ballots must be postmarked and when they must be returned to an election office in order to be eligible to be counted vary widely. UOCAVA Registration and Ballot Requests The 2016 general election was the first time that registered overseas citizens outnumbered registered uniformed services members covered by UOCAVA. This trend continued in 2020, with uniformed services members or eligible family members accounting for 42.3 of registered UOCAVA voters and overseas citizens accounting for 57.4 of thi s population. 12 Registered UOCAVA voters  legal voting residences13 are disproportionately concentrated in just a few U.S. states . In 2020, the states with the largest numbers of registered UOCAVA voters were Florida 191,628, California 187,213, and Washington 127,976.14 Together, these three states represented 40.4 of all registered UOCAVA voters reported in the 2020 EAVS. Twenty two local jurisdictions15 reported having 10,000 or more registered UOCAVA voters, and seven reported more 12 The total number of registered and eligible UOCAVA voters was collected in item B1a of the 2020 EAVS. The number of registered and eligible uniformed services UOCAVA voters was collected in item B1b the percentage of uniformed services UOCAVA voters was calculated by dividing B1b by B1a. The number of registered and eligible overseas citizen UOCAVA voters was collected in item B1c the percentage of overseas citizen UOCAVA voters was calculated by dividing B1c by B1a. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating the national percentage. In total , 870 jurisdictions in 10 states did not report data in B1 this count excludes jurisdictions in Maine, which report ed UOCAVA data at the state level and not the jurisdiction level. A total of 8,167 registered and eligible voters reported in B1a were not classified as either uniformed services or overseas citizens . These percentages exclude the seven states that did not report the number of registered UOCAVA voters as well as the state and territory that did not subdivide this number by UOCAVA voter type. 13 According to FVAPs guidance for service members , Your voting residence is within your state of legal residence or domicile. It is the address that you consider your permanent home and where you had a physical presence. Your state of legal residence is used for state income tax purposes, determines eligibility to vote for federal and state elections, and qualification for in state tuition rates.  For more information, see httpswww.fvap.govmilitary votervoting residence . 14 The total number of registered and eligible UOCAVA voters in a state was calculated by summing B1a across all jurisdictions for each state. 15 What constitutes a jurisdiction for EAVS reporting is defined by how each state chose to provide data . For the 2020 EAVS, m ost states repor ted data on the county level or county equivalent, such as parishes for Louisiana. Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, and Virginia reported data for independent cities in addition to counties. The territories, the District of Columbia, and Alaska each repor ted as a single jurisdiction. Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin re ported data on the township level. Maine also repor ted its UOCAVA data in Section B as a separate jurisdiction , because this information was only collected at the state level. Michigan reported data for the county level, but most election administration ac tivities take place in the 1,520 local election jurisdictions in the state . 176  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 than 15,000 registered and eligible UOCAVA voters. These seven jurisdictions accounted for 15.3 of all registered UOCAVA voters see Table 1 . Table 1.

Alaska reported 16,194 total registered UOCAVA voters and reported as a single jurisdiction in the EAVS  however, it was not included in the table because the table focuses on localities rather than complete states. Figure 2. Most Jurisdictions Had Fewer Than 50 Registered UOCAVA Voters Sourc e Information for the number of registered and eligible UOCAVA voters was collected in item B1a of the 2020 EAVS. Military and Overseas Voting in 2020  177 Conversely, of the 5,0 94 local jurisdictions for which the number of registered UOCAVA voters was available, 80.9 reported fewer than 100 registered UOCAVA voters, including 371 jurisdictions that reported having zero UOCAVA voters in 2020. Figure 2 shows the number of registered UOCAVA voters by jurisdiction. Election offices reported receiving 764,691 FPCAs ahead of the 2020 general election, which was almost d ouble the 420,861 FPCAs that states reported receiving ahead of the 2016 general election. Overall, 30.3 of these registration and absentee ballot requests came from uniformed services members , and 66.9 were submitted by overseas citizens .16 States reported rejecting 2.7 of the FPCAs receiv ed, of which 15. 2 were rejected because the election office received the form after their states absentee ballot request deadline.17 The FPCA rejection rate among uniformed services members was slightly higher than among overseas citizens , with 3. 3 of military FPCAs rejected compared to 2. 3 of FPCAs submitted by overseas citizens .18 UOCAVA Ballots Transmitted In 2020, election offices in the 50 states, five U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia reported transmitting 1,249,601 ballots to UOCAVA voters.19 Figure 3 shows the number of ballots sent out from election offices or transmitted for each state. The states colored in dark blue represent the states that distributed the most ballots to UOCAVA voters. The states colored in light blue are the states tha t distributed the fewest ballots to UOCAVA voters. 16 Data on the total number of FPCAs submitted was collected in item B2a of the 2020 EAVS. In 2016, this data was collected in item B20a. For 2020, the percentage of FPCAs received from uniformed services members was calculated as B2bB2a. The percentage of FPCAs received from overseas citizen voters was calculated as B2cB2a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating these percentages. 17 The total number of FPCAs rejected was collected in item B3a in the 2020 EAVS the percentage of FPCAs rejected was calculated as B3aB2a. The percentage of FPCAs rejected because they were received late was calculated as B4aB3a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating these percentages. 18 The percentage of rejected FPCAs from uniformed services voters was calculated as B3bB2b. The percentage of rejected FPCAs from overseas citizen voters was calculated as B3cB2c. Overall, 6.9 of r ejected FPCAs were not categorized by UOCAVA voter type. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating these percentages. 19 The number of transmitted UOCAVA ballots was collected in item B5a of the 2020 EAVS. The number of ballots transmitted to UOCAVA voters was reported by all but 36 jurisdictions. Rhode Island did not report data on the number of ballots transmitted. 178  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 Figure 3. Ballot Transmissions W ere the Highest in States With Large UOCAVA Populations Sourc e Information on the number of transmitted UOCAVA ballots was collected in item B5a of the 2020 EAVS. State level data were aggregated from jurisdiction data. Cutoff points in the graph were selected to reflect states that had the lowest and highest number of UOCAVA ballots transmitted and to differentiate among the states in between the lowest and highest UOCAVA ballot transmission numbers. Of the UO CAVA ballots transmitted, 39.4 were sent to uniformed services members, and 60.1 were transmitted to overseas citizen voters.20 Figure 4 shows that the percentage of ballots transm itted to overseas citizens has continued to rise steadily over the last several election cycles, increasing by 15.4 percentage points since the 2012 general election. Although the nationwide percentage of ballots sent to overseas citizens was greater than the percentage sent to uniformed services members, t he proportion of ballots sent to overseas citizens or uniformed services members varied by state. Kentucky and Louisiana , for example, reported that UOCAVA ballots were split about evenly between uniformed service s members and overseas citizen voters however, the District of Columbia and Massachusetts reported that the vast majority of UOCAVA ballots were transmitted to overseas citizens 97.1 and 94.2, respectively . In Alaska, American Samoa, New Mexico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, more than 20 The percentage of UOCAVA ballots transmitted to uniformed services voters was calculated as B5bB5a. The percentage of UOCAVA ballots transmitted to overseas citizen voters was calculated as B5cB5a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level when calculating these percentages. An additional 1 of the transmitted ballots could not be classified by voter type. Military and Overseas Voting in 2020  179 three quarters of UOCAVA ballots were transmitted to uniformed services members. Figure 5 shows the percentage of ballots transmitted to uniformed services voters versus overseas citizen voters. Figu re 4. Steady Increase in the Percentage of UOCAVA Ballots Transmitted to Overseas Citizens Relative to Uniformed Services Members Source The percentage of UOCAVA ballots transmitted to uniformed services voters was calculated as B1bB1a x 100 for the 2012, 2014, and 2016 EAVS and B5bB5a x 100 for the 2018 and the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of UOCAVA ballots transmitted to overseas citizen s was calculated as B1cB1a x 100 for the 2012, 2014, and 2016 EAVS, and B5cB5a x 100 for the 2018 and the 2020 EAVS. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating these percentages percentages may not sum to 100. Ballots that were not classified as being from either overseas citizen s or uniformed services voters were not included in this analysis. 180  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 Figure 5. Twenty Four States Transmitted More UOCAVA Ballots to Uniformed Services Members Than to Overseas Citizens Source The percentage of UOCAVA ballots transmitted to overseas citizens was calculated as B5cB5a x 100 for the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of UOCAVA ballots transmitted to uniformed services voters was calculated as B5bB5a x 100 for the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of uncategorized ballots was calculated as B5a B5b B5cB5a x 100 for the 2020 EAVS.

Military and Overseas Voting in 2020  181 Modes of UOCAVA Ballot Transmission Over the last several election cycles, the modes by which absentee ballots have been transmitted to voters have changed substantially. Since the passage of the MOVE Act, transmission of ballots to UOCAVA voters has increasingly occurred electronically. Email was the most popular method of ballot transmission for the 2020 general election, with 62.3 of absentee ballots transmitted to UOCAVA voters via email, 32 transmitted via postal mail, and 7.9 sent to voters through some other mode of transmission e.g., fax or online systems. 21 By comparison, during the previous presidential election cycle in 2016, among states that provided data on transmission by mode, 59.8 of ballots were trans mitted via email, and in 2018, email represented 56.6 of UOCAVA ballots that were transmitted. 22 Figure 6 displays the percentage of ballots transmitted by mail, email, or other modes for the 2020 general election. Modes of ballot transmission differed based on UOCAVA voter type. The transmission mode among uniformed services members was almost evenly split between mail transmission 47.8 and email transmission 46.7. For ballots transmitted to overseas citizens, most ballots were transmitted by email 70.9 while ballots transmitted by mail accounted for 22.2 of ballots transmitted. For both groups, between 7 and 7.9 of ballots were transmitted by other modes, including fax and online ballot delivery portals. Overall, 1 of all ballots transmitted to UOCAVA voters were returned as undeliverable, including mailed ballots returned to sender, emailed ballots that bounced back, and ballots that were undeliverable by other modes, such as an incorrect fax number. 23 21 The percentage of ballots transmitted by email was calculated as B7aB5a for the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of ballots transmitted by postal mail was calculated as B6aB5a. The percentage of ballots transmitted by other modes of transmission was calculated as B8aB5a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in these calculations. All but three states reported ballots transmitted by mode in 2020. Two additional states did not report the number of ballots transmitted by email. These states were excluded from calculations of the percentage of ballots transmitted by a given mode. However, the percentages by mode did not change substantively when transmitted ballots from these states were included in analysis. 22 Until 2018, questions about mode of ballot re ceipt and return were asked in relation to the 45 day MOVE Act transmission deadline. Specifically, How many UOCAVA absentee ballots did your jurisdiction transmit to UOCAVA voters using the following modes of transmission, before and after the 45 day deadline? Starting in 2018, the survey was updated so that mode questions did not include this distinction. The percentage of ballots transmitted by email was calculated as B7aB5a for the 2018 EAVS. The percentage of ballots transmitted by email was calcula ted as B24TotalB1a for the 2016 EAVS. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in these calculations. In 2016, 27 of the 55 states that answered the EAVS provided information on transmission by mode. 23 The percentage of ballots returned as undeliverable was calculated as B13aB5a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating this percentage. States and jurisdictions vary in the extent to which they are able to capture and report undeliverable ballots, overall and by mode of transmissio n. 182  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 Figure 6. Modes of Ballot Transmission Differ for Overseas Citizens and Uniformed Services Members Source The percentages of UOCAVA ballots transmitted overall were calculated as B7aB5a x 100 for email, B6aB5a x 100 for postal mail, and B8aB5a x 100 for other modes. The percentages of UOCAVA ballots transmitted to uniformed services voters were calculated as B7bB5b x 100 for email, B6bB5b x 100 for postal mail, and B8bB5b x 100 for other modes. The percentages of UOCAVA ballots transmitted for overseas citizens were calculated as B7cB5c x 100 for email, B6cB5c x 100 for postal mail, and B8cB5c x 100 for other modes. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating these percentages percentages may not sum to 100. UOCAVA Ballots Returned and Submitted for Counting States reported 911,614 regular absentee ballots  73 of those transmitted to voters through any mode were returned and submitted for counting by UOCAVA voters for the 2020 general election.24 This is a 39 increase over 2016, when 655,844 regular absentee ballots were returned by UOCAVA voters.25 Figure 7 shows the UOCAVA ballot return totals by state in 2020 . The states colored in dark 24 The total number of returned UOCAVA ballots was collected in item B9a in the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of transmitted UOCAVA ballots that were returned was calculated as B9aB5a. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating this percen tage. More than 82 of jurisdictions reported the number of ballots returned and submitted for counting. FWABs were reported separately from regular UOCAVA absentee ballots and were not included in these figures. Because more than one ballot may be transmitted to an individual voter e.g., because the original was returned undeliverable or was spoiled and replaced, this rate likely underestimates the rate of ballot return by UOCAVA voters. 25 The total number of returned UOCAVA ballots was collected in item B2a in the 2016 EA VS. Military and Overseas Voting in 2020  183 blue represent the states that had the highest ballot return totals. The states colored in light blue were the states that had the lowest ballot return totals. Figure 7. UOCAVA Ballot Return Rates W ere the Highest in the Northeast and Midwest Sour ce The percentage of transmitted UOCAVA ballots that were returned by voters was calculated as B9aB5a x 100. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating the percentages shown in this map. States are grouped by quartiles rounded to the nearest integer. Of the ballots returned to election offices, 36.3 were returned by uniformed services members , and 62.9 were returned by overseas citizens.26 Overall, 63.8 of absentee ballots returned and submitted for counting by UOCAVA voters were returned to the election office via postal mail, 37.7 were returned by email, and 16.5 were returned through some other mode e.g., fax or an online system.27 Twenty three s tates indicated that they do not allow or did not report email ballot return. 26 The percentage of UOCAVA ballots returned by uniformed services members was calculated as B9bB9a. The percentage of UOCAVA ballots returned by overseas citizen voters was calculated as B9cB9a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calcu lating these percentages. 27 The percentage of UOCAVA ballots returned by postal mail was calculated as B10aB9a. The percentage of UOCAVA ballots returned by email was calculated as B11aB9a. The percentage of UOCAVA ballots returned by some other mode was calculated as B12aB9a. Casewise deletion was use d at the state level in calculating these percentages. Four states did not report t he number of ballots returned by mode and were excluded from all mode analysis. In addition, 23 states did not report ballo ts returned via email, and 28 did not report ballots returned by some other mode. If all states are included in the analysis, 61.8 of ballots were returned via mail, 23.1 via email, 11.7 by some other mode, and 3.3 of returned ballots were not categori zed by mode. 184  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 Among the states that reported UOCAVA ballots returned by email, 42.5 of ballots were returned through email, and 45.2 were returned via mail .28 Figure 8 . Although Many UOCAVA Voters, Especially Overseas Citizen s, Use Email to Return Their Completed Absentee Ballot, Postal Mail I s the Primary Mode of Ballot Return Source The percentages of UOCAVA ballots returned by mode overall were calculated as B10aB9a x 100 for postal mail and B11aB9a x 100 for email. The percentages of UOCAVA ballots returned by mode for uniformed services members were calculated as B10bB9b x 100 for postal mail and B11bB9b x 100 for email. The percentages of UOCAVA ballots returned by mode for overseas citizen s were calculated as B10cB9c x 100 for postal mail and B11cB9c x 100 for email. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating these percentages , and because percentages for each type of voter and each mode of return were calculated independently and only states that reported data for a given mode of return were included in the analysis, the percentages do not sum to 100. Other modes of ballot return are not shown here. Altho ugh postal mail was the most common mode of ballot return for both uniformed services and overseas citizen voters, uniformed services members used email return far less than overseas 28 Thirty three states reported at least one email ballot returned item B11a in the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of ballots returned by email was calculated as B11aB9a among states reporting at least one email ballot returned item B11a in the 2020 EAVS.

Ov erall, 889,837 regular absentee ballots returned by UOCAVA voters were counted in the 2020 general election. Of these votes, 63.1 were cast by overseas citizens and 36.5 by uniformed services voters.30 The overall rejection rate for regular absentee ballots returned by UOCAVA voters was 2.1, less than half the overall rejection rate of 5.7  reported in 2018.31 The overall rejection rate did not differ significantly across UOCAVA voter types.32 Figure 9 shows the number of rejected UOCAVA ballots returned and submitted by voters for counting in each state. The states that are colored in dark blue represent the states that reported the highest number of rejected ballots , and the states that are colored in light blue reported the lowest number of rejected ballots. Rejected ballots were divided into three reasons for rejection missed deadline, problem with voter signature, and lacked postmark.33 By far the most common reason for rejection was that a ballot was received after a states deadline for UOCAVA absentee ballot receipt. Of the 19,060returned UOCAVA ballots rejected, 8,188 were rejected because they were received after the state deadline, which was 43.5 of all UOCAVA ballot rejections.34 Voter signa ture problems were responsible for 19.6 of all UOCAVA ballot rejections, 3.3 of ballot rejections were the result of postmark issues, and 47.3 of rejections were caused by some other issue. 35 29 The percentage of UOCAVA ballots returned by email by uniformed services members was calculated as B1 1bB9b. The percentage of UOCAVA ballots returned by email by overseas citizens was calculated as B11 cB9c. Of note, two of the states with the largest numbers of UOCAVA votersCalifornia and Florida do not allow email return of absentee ballots. 30 The total number of UOCAVA ballots that were returned by voters and counted was collected in item B14a of the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of ballots that were returned by uniformed services members was calculated as B14bB14a. The percentage of ballots that were returned by overseas citizen voters was calculated as B14cB14a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating these percentages. An additional 12,919 1. 5 UOCAVA absentee ballots counted were not classified by voter type. 31 Before survey revisions were made in the 2018 EAVS, UOCAVA ballot rejection data included both regular absentee ballots and FWABs, making direct comparisons with years before 2018 complicated. The 2016 ballot rejection rate was calculated as B16aB16bB16cB26b and produce d an overall rejection rate of 2.4 . 32 The rejection rate for UOCAVA ballots was calculated as B18aB9a for the 2018 and 2020 EAVS. The percentage of ballots rejected from uniformed services voters was calculated as B18bB9b. The percentage of ballots rejected from overseas citizen voters was calculated as B18cB9c. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating these percentages. The rejection rate for returned ballots was 2  for uniformed services members, 2.1 for overseas citizens, and 6.3 among rejected ballots not classifie d by voter type. 33 Two states Mississippi and Rhode Island and four U.S. territories American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands did not report the number of ballots rejected. The number of ballots rejected was reported for 81.7 of jurisdictions nationwide. Most of these jurisdictions also subdivided rejected ballots by reason for rejection. New Jersey was not able to separate regular UOCAVA ballots from FWABs information on all of the UOCAVA ballots rejected in New Jersey in the 2018 election is available in the survey comments. 34 The total number of UOCAVA ballots rejected for being received after the state deadline was item B19a of the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of UOCAVA ballots rejected for being received l ate was calculated as B19aB18a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating this percentage. 35 The percentage of UOCAVA ballots rejected because of signature issues was calculated as B20aB18a. The percentage of UOCAVA ballots rejected be cause of postmark issues was calculated as B21aB18a. The percentage of UOCAVA ballots rejected for other reasons was calculated as B22aB18a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating these percentages. The increase in other reasons for rejection may reflect a large increase in the use of this category by certain states, in particular New York with 2,098 71.5 of their rejections and Virginia 2,531 217 .3 of their rejections. These two states accoun ted for more than half of the total other rejections. 186  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 Figure 9.

Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating the percentages shown in this map. Cutoff points in the graph were selected to reflect states that had the lowest and highest percentage of UOCAVA ballot rejection rates and to differentiate among the states in between the lowest and highest UOCAVA ballot rejection rates. Unif ormed services members and overseas citizen UOCAVA ballots were rejected for similar reasons. Missing the deadline was the most common reason for rejection among both populations44.7  for uniformed services members and 41.3  for overseas citizens . Signature issues were the cause of 27.3 of ballot rejections for ballots returned by uniformed services members, almost twice the percentage of overseas citizen ballots rejected for this reason  13.7 .36 36 The percentage of ballots rejected for missing the deadline was calculated as B19bB18b for uniformed services voters and B19cB18c for overseas citizens . The percentage of ballots rejected because of signature issues was calculated as B20bB18b for uniformed services voters and B20cB18c for overseas citizens .

Alt hough the 33,027 FWABs submitted in 2020 made up a relatively small proportion 3.8 of all the UOCAVA ballots returned, there was a 41.1 increase in the volume of FWABs reported compared to the 2016 presidential election.37 Despite the increase from previous elections, FWAB usage remains a relatively small proportion of the UOCAVA metho ds of voting among both uniformed services members and overseas citizen voters. Howeve r, the FWAB resulted in 23,897 additional UOCAVA voters  ballots counted in the 2020 general election, with 24.2 of these additional voters from uniformed services members and 73.2  from overseas citizens.38 Thirteen states and territories reported that they received no FWABs during the 2020 presidential election.39 Roughly one in four  8,43 8 or 25.6  of the 33,027 FWABs submitted in the 2020 general election were not counted. Of these, 3,965 FWABs 47.1  of the rejected FWAB swere replaced by a regular absentee ballot, making the backup ballot unnecessary.40 The rate of uncounted FWABs returned by uniformed services members was similar to the rate of uncounted FWAB s returned by overseas citizens 27.6 and 21.5, respectively.41 The other major reason FWABs went uncounted and the 37 The percentage of all ballots returned that were FWABs was calculated using the total number of FWABs received B23a divided by the total number of UOCAVA ballots received the sum of B9a and B23a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating this percentage. The total number of FWABs received was collected in item B23a in the 2020 EAVS and the sum of B31a, B31b, B31c , and B31d in the 2016 EAVS. In 2016, states reported receiving 23,412 FWABs. For 2020, The total number of FWABs returned was based on 82.1 of jurisdictions for which this information was available. 38 The total number of FWABs received and counted was item B24a of the 2020 EAVS. The number of FWABs counted from uniformed services members was item B24b, and the number of FWABs counted from overseas citizens was item B24c. The percentage of counted FWABs returned by uniformed services members was calculated as B24bB24a. The percentage of counted FWABs returned by overseas citizens was calculated as B24cB24a. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating this percentage. 39 American Samoa, Guam , and Puerto Rico reported receiving zero FWABs. Georgia, Iowa, Oregon, and South Carolina reported FWABs with regular UOCAVA ballots because they could not separate the two types. 40 The number of FWABs rejected because the voters regular absentee ballot was received and counted was item B26a of the 2020 EAVS. The percentage of rejected FWABs that were rejected for this reason was calculated as B26aB25aB26aB27a. Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating the percentage. 41 The total percentage of FWABs rejected was calculated as B25aB26aB27aB23a. The percentage of FWABs rejected from uniformed services members was calculated as B25bB26bB27bB23b. The percentage of FWABs rejected from overseas citizen voters was calculated as B25cB26cB27cB23c. Casewise deletion was used at the state level in calculating these percentages. The Federal Write In Absentee Ba llot FWAB The FWAB is a special type of UOCAVA ballot that may be used as a backup in the event that a voters regular absentee ballot does not arrive in time to vote. In most states, a UOCAVA voter must have registered and requested an absentee ballot in order to use the FWAB. 188  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 only other reason states reported via the EAVS was because they were received after the ballot receipt deadline 13.1 of rejected FWABs .42 42 The percentage of rejected FWABs that were rejected because they were received after the deadline was calculated as B25aB25aB26aB27a.

UOCAVA Table 3 Data Notes  General Notes Casewise deletion at the state level was used in calculating national percentages. The percentage calculations at the national level U.S. Total only used data from those states that provided data for the numerator and denominator of the calculation. 1Georgia, Iowa, Oregon, and South Carolina reported that data on FWABs were included in th e EAV S items related to UOCAVA absentee ballots because FWABs cannot be distinguished from regular UOCAVA absentee ballots.200  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 2Kootenai County in Idaho responded Data not available to the number of UOCAVA ballots returned B9a  and reported 317 UOCAVA ballots counted B14a. Because of these responses, the total number of UOCAVA ballots received at the state level was lower than the total number of UOCAVA ballots counted, and the percentage of counted ballots exceeded 100 in Idaho. 3Louisiana noted in a survey comment that  The r egistrar sometimes transmits multiple ballots to voter i.e. the voter did not receive the original ballot or the original ballot is returned as undeliverable. 4Montana noted in a survey comment that  Bal lots issued may exceed voter registration due to replacement ballot issued. 5New York noted in a survey comment that While the UOCAVA data reflects information provided by the cou nties, it does not address the variable that voters may return more than one ballot. The following further addresses this variable 1If voters have electronic access to their ballot, they could potentially download and print the do cu ments more than once and subsequently return t hem to the county boards. 2Some county boards mail a ballot to every UOCAVA voter, regardless of their transmission preference. Due to this, voters who already received their ballot electronically, completed and returned it, may subsequently receive a physical ballot in the mail. This may result in such voters returning this additional ballot. 3Additional data collected by NYS BOE New York State Board of Elections has shown that more than 1700 UOCAVA voters returned multiple ballots, although the data does not report how many ballots each of these voters returned.  6The Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands reported that items related to rejected UOCA VA absentee ballots did not apply. 7Puerto Rico reported that data in items related to rejected UOCAVA absentee ballots did not apply. 8Rhode Island noted in a survey comment that  Acc ording to RI general law all UOCAVA mail ballots are consolidated into one mail ballot category. 9South Carolina noted in a survey comment that UOCAVA ballots counted equals UOCAVA ballots retu rned before deadline. No data available on UOCAVA ballots that may have been challe nged. 10 The U.S. Virgin Islands reported that items related to rejected UOCAVA absentee ballots did not apply, with a survey comment that  The five voters did not return their ballots that were sent to them.  11 In Wisconsin, other methods of tra nsmitting UOCAVA ballots include online ballot delivery, fax, or email. There were some UOCAVA voters who voted at the polls on Election Day, rather than by UOCAVA absentee ballot these voters are not included in Section B but are included in the numbe rs for Section D. Wisconsin does not have a postmark requirement for absentee ballots absentee ballots must be received by the local clerk before polls close on Election Day. Many Wisconsin jurisdictions track the return of ballots received after Election Day, but they are not required to do so. Counts reported for Ballot not received on timemissed deadline represent the ballots that have been tracked in this way. In Wisconsin, ballots missing a postmark are counted if they otherwise qualify therefore, there are no ballots rejected for this reason.Military and Overseas Voting in 2020  201 UOCAVA Table 4 Federal Write In Absentee Ballots FWAB State Total FWABs Received FWABs Counted FWABs Rejected FWABs Not Categorized Total  of Total Received Total  of Total Received Total  of Total Received Alabama 254 190 74.8 64 25.2 0 0.0 Alaska 155 97 62.6 58 37.4 0 0.0 American Samoa 0 0  0  0  Arizona 236 186 78.8 50 21.2 0 0.0 Arkansas 45 43 95.6 2 4.4 0 0.0 California 1 3,474 1,723 49.6 1,575 45.3 176 5.1 Colorado 150 146 97.3 4 2.7 0 0.0 Connecticu t 2        Delaware 87 64 73.6 23 26.4 0 0.0 District of Columbia 380 309 81.3 71 18.7 0 0.0 Florida 1,726 833 48.3 883 51.2 10 0.6 Georgi a 3        Guam 0 0  0  0  Hawaii 12 12 100.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 Idaho 30 12 40.0 23 76.7 5 16.7 Illinois 1,156 916 79.2 240 20.8 0 0.0 Indiana 1,534 1,170 76.3 40 2.6 324 21.1 Iowa 3        Kansas 169 141 83.4 27 16.0 1 0.6 Kentuck y 4 106     106 100.0 Louisiana 30 28 93.3 2 6.7 0 0.0 Maine 106 97 91.5 9 8.5 0 0.0 Maryland 943 491 52.1 452 47.9 0 0.0 Massachusetts 647 646 99.8 1 0.2 0 0.0 Michigan  5 949 329 34.7 620 65.3 0 0.0 Minnesota 506 333 65.8 173 34.2 0 0.0 Mississippi 3 3 100.0 1 33.3 1 33.3 Missouri 301 301 100.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 Montana 61 56 91.8 5 8.2 0 0.0 Nebraska 81 80 98.8 1 1.2 0 0.0 Nevada 222 221 99.5 1 0.5 0 0.0 New Hampshire 86 85 98.8 1 1.2 0 0.0 New Jersey 9,333 9,269 99.3 55 0.6 9 0.1 New Mexico 6 131 83 63.4 48 36.6 0 0.0 New York 3,088 1,637 53.0 1,424 46.1 27 0.9202  Military and Overseas Voting in 2020 State Total FWABs Received FWABs Counted FWABs Rejected FWABs Not Categorized Total  of Total Received Total  of Total Received Total  of Total Received North Carolina 921 910 98.8 11 1.2 0 0.0 North Dakota 29 29 100.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 Northern Mariana Island s 7        Ohio 8 789 466 59.1 313 39.7 10 1.3 Oklahoma 207 162 78.3 45 21.7 0 0.0 Orego n 3        Pennsylvania 242 235 97.1 7 2.9 0 0.0 Puerto Rico 0 0  0  0  Rhode Islan d 9        South Carolin a 3        South Dakota 14 12 85.7 2 14.3 0 0.0 Tennessee 456 232 50.9 224 49.1 0 0.0 Texas 2,839 912 32.1 1,925 67.8 2 0.1 U.S. Virgin Island s 10        Utah 2        Vermon t 11        Virginia 12 448 448 100.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 Washington 898 894 99.6 4 0.4 0 0.0 West Virginia 45 39 86.7 6 13.3 0 0.0 Wisconsi n 13 137 56 40.9 48 35.0 33 24.1 Wyoming 1 1 100.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 U.S. Total 33,027 23,897 72.6 8,438 25.6 692 2.1 UOCAVA Table 4 Calculation Notes  Total FWABs Re ceived uses question B23a.

The percentage calculations at the national level U.S. Total only used data from those states that provided data for the numerator and denominator of the calculation. Negative numbers in the Not Categorized FWABs category indicate that the sum of counted and rejected FWABs account for more than the total number of FWABs received as reported by the state. The EAVS tracks data on FWABs that were rejected because they were received after the ballot receipt deadline B25, because the voters regular absentee ballot was received and countedB26, and for other reasons B27. 1In California, a lar ge number of FWAB rejections occurred because regular vote bymail ballots were already returned and counted for the same voter, and because of missing signatures, incomplete information, or receipt after deadline. 2Connecticut and Utah reported that data on items related to FWABs were not available. 3Georgia, Iowa, Oregon, and South Carolina reported that data on items related to FWABs were not availab le because FWABs cannot be distinguished from regular UOCAVA absentee ballots. 4Kentucky reported that data on items related to counted and rejected FWABs were not available. This stat e also noted in a survey comment that  Reject reason not tracked. 5Michigan noted in a survey comment that  All FWABs received were either counted, received a regular ballot that was counted, or arrived late. 6In New Mexico, t he reason for rejection is not tracked by counties at this time. 7The Northern Mariana Islands reported that data on items related to FWABs were not available, with a su rv ey comment that  The election statute does not allow for Federal Write in Absentee Ballot. 8Ohio noted for multiple counties that the  Tot al in B23a does include B26a. Source information for militaryoverseas voters for B26a is not tracked. B ecause of this, B23b  B23c will not always equal B23a. 9Rhode Island noted in a survey comment that  Acc ording to RI general law all UOCAVA mail ballots are consolidated into one mail ballot category. 10 The U.S. Virgin Islands reported that data on items related to FWABs were not available. 11 Vermont reported that data on FWABs were not available. 12 Local election officials in Virginia do not enter information relating to rejected FWABs into the states cen tral system and only enter information on FWABs that are accepted and counted. 13 In Wisconsin, m any jurisdictions track the return of ballots received after Election Day but are not required to do so. The counts reported in Total number of FWABs rejected because it was received after the ballot receipt deadline B25a are limited to ballots in jurisdictions that recorded these in the statewide database.204  Survey Methodology and Procedures Chapter 5. Survey Methodology and Procedures Sin ce 2004, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission EAC has conducted the Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS following each federal general election. The project collects data on election policies, voter registra tion, voting by individuals covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act UOCAVA, mail voting, in person voting, poll workers and polling places, provisional voting, election technology, and turnout . All U.S. states, U.S. territories , and the District of Columbia are included in the EAVS.1 The EAVS helps the EAC meet its mandate under the Help America Vote Act HAVA to serve as a national clearinghouse and resource for the compilation of information and the review of procedures with respect to the administration of f ederal elections. The EAVS collectively consists of two surveys administered separately The Election Administration Policy Survey Policy Survey , which collects data on state election policies and procedures, was administered from August to December 2020. The information collected through the Policy Survey helps provide context to the data reported through the EAVS. The EAVS, which collects data a bout registrations, voters, and ballots in the 2020 general election, was administered from December 2020 to July 2021. The data collected through the EAVS allow states to satisfy their data reporting requirements established by the National Voter Registra tion Act  NVRA and UOCAVA and provide a detailed snapshot of how general elections are administered in the United States every two years . This report relies on EAVS data submitted and certified by 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territo ries. Data for each state were collected at the jurisdiction level, with 6,460 of the 6,460 jurisdictions nationwide 100 submitting at least partial data in 2020 . 2 Appendix A of this chapter shows the number of jurisdictions and the response rate by state overall and for each section of the EAVS. 1 Throughout this report, unless otherwise specified, the term state can be understood to apply to the 50 U.S . states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that submit Election Administration Policy Survey and EAVS data. Puerto Rico provides EAVS data only in presidential election years, as it does not hold elections for federal candidates in midterm election years. American Samoa did not participate in the 2016 EAVS. The Northern Mariana Islands participated in the EAVS for the first time in 2020. 2 What constitutes a jurisdiction for EAVS reporting is defined by how each state chose to provide data . For the 2020 EAVS, most states repor ted data on the county level or county equivalent, such as parishes for Louisiana. Il linois, Maryland, Missouri, and Virginia reported data for independent cities in addition to counties. The territories, the District of Columbia, and Alaska each repor ted as a single jurisdiction. Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin repor ted data on the township level. Maine also repor ted its UOCAVA data in Section B as a separate jurisdiction , because this information was only collected at the state level. Michigan reported data for the county level, but most election administration activities take place in the 1,520 local election jurisdictions in the state . See Appendix A in this chapter for a breakdown of the number of jurisdictions reported in each state. Elections for Kalawao County in Hawaii are administered by Maui County although Kalawao is included as a jurisdiction in the EAVS data, Kalawaos data are included with Mauis data. Survey Methodology and Procedures  205 Survey Questions The 2020 Policy Survey consisted of 80 questions 41 required questions, 23 follow up questions based on a states responses to the required questions, and 16 optional comments boxes. Of the se, 58 were single select or multiselect questions, 20 were open ended with a text response, and two were hybrid single select and text questions. The 2020 EAVS consisted of 407 questions 217 required, 79 follow up questions based on a jurisdictions resp onses to the required questions, 77 optional questions based on whether a jurisdiction had additional data to provide, and 34 optional comments boxes. Of these questions, 253 were fill in the blank with a numerical response, 37 were item descriptions, 65 were single  select questions, and 52 were open ended with a text response. The content of the questions in the EAVS has largely been unchanged since the 2008 survey, although questions are periodically removed, updated, or reordered. The Policy Survey was significantly reorganized in 2018 and was converted to a set of closed ende d questions. The 2020 Policy Survey was significantly revised and expanded from the 2018 survey. The full set of EAVS and Policy Survey questions can be found at httpsw ww.eac.govresearch anddatadatasets  codebooks andsurveys . The following sections detail the data collected by these surveys and the changes that were made to the questions from the 2018 versions. In 2020, the primary changes to the survey questions involved Adding Policy Survey questions that could be used to validate EAVS items. Removing a redundant EAVS question, adding one new EAVS question, and adding two sub  questions to an existing EAVS question. Clarifying instructions to make compl etion easier for election officials and to improve data quality. Policy Survey Since 2008, the EAVS has been accompanied by a survey that collects information on states election policies and practices to provide greater context for the jurisdiction level data collected through the EAVS. This originally took the form of the Statutory Overview, which consisted of open  ended questions on statutory requirements for various parts of the election process , asking states to report information on their election law s and policies. However, the open ended format made it difficult to interpret states statutory language, identify patterns in election practices, and draw meaningful comparisons between states. Beginning with the 2018 EAVS, the Statutory Overview was sign ificantly redesigned and renamed the Policy Survey. The survey now uses closed ended questions and is intended to capture states broad policies rather than to represent a comprehensive overview of state statutory language. This allows for greater ease in interpreting the results , creating comparisons across states, and providing 206  Survey Methodology and Procedures context in understanding the EAVS data. The Policy Survey questions are designed to map onto the EAVS data questions so that the two surveys can be used in concert. The 2020 Policy Survey collected information on election infrastructure how the state answers the EAVS voter registration and list maintenance election technology mail voting in person voting before Election Day vote centers UOCAVA voting provisional voting elec tion certification, recounts, and audits voter identification and how criminal convictions affect voting. The 2020 Policy Survey was significantly revised and expanded compared to the 2018 survey. New additions to the Policy Survey included New Question for 2020 Description Q1, Q1a, Q2, Q2a, Q2b, and Q2c Information on a states election infrastructure, including the name, title, and duties of the chief state election official the names and EAVS responsibilities of state election offices the names and EAVS responsibilities of local election offices whether any jurisdictions had been added or consolidated since the 2018 EAVS and contact information including the office name, physical address, mailing address, phone number, website, and email address for all state and local election offices within the state. Q6a and Q6b Information on how a state implements its automatic or automated voter registration process, including how individuals could decline to be registered. Q7b Features incorporated into a states online registration system. Q8 Online voting information search tools available on the states election website. Q10 Preregistration of voters before they turn 18 years of age. Q11, Q11a, Q11b Whether the state designates certain voters as inactive, and if so, what actions would result in an active voter being designated as inactive and what actions would result in an inactive voter being designated as active. Q12 Whether state officials, local officials, or bot h are responsible for modifying or removing voter registration records. Q13, Q13a Whether the state sends confirmation notices, whether the confirmation notices are sent pursuant to the NVRA, pursuant to state statute , or formal administrative rule or guidance, and which types of voters are sent confirmation notices. Q14 What data sources a state uses to identify potentially ineligible voters on their voter registration rolls. Q15, Q15a Policy on voting system testing and certification and what type of testing and certification is required. Q16, Q16a Whether electronic poll books are used in the state and whether testing and certification for those electronic poll books is required. Q21 How long a state tracks mail ed ballots for inclusion in its EAVS Section C data. Q22 What types of markings satisfy the states postmark requirement for mail ed ballots. Q23 Which voters may receive ballots electronically. Q30 The d eadline for overseas UOCAVA voters to return their ballots. This question was designed to match a question on domestic military UOCAVA voters that had been in the 2018 Policy Survey but was renumbered and redesigned for 2020 Q29. Survey Methodology and Procedures  207 New Question for 2020 Description Q31 Whether UOCAVA ballots have different postmark requirements for mailed ballots. Q32, Q32a, Q32b Whether the state uses provisional ballots, and if so, what circumstances warrant a voter being provided a provisional ballot and the deadline for adjudicating provisional ballots. Q33 States election certification deadline. Q35a What types of audits a state conducts. Q36a Deadline for a voter to present valid identification if they do not have identification at the polls and must take further action to prove their identity. Questi ons that were significantly revised from the 2018 Policy Survey included Significantly Revised from 2018 Description Q5 Government entities that transmit data to the centralized state database. This question had been Q3 and Q4 in 2018. For 2020, this question was collapsed from three to two subcategories, including a binary yesno question on whether the government entity transfers data and a single select, follow up question with how frequently the data transmission occurs. Q6 Whether the state registers individuals to vote automatically or via an automated process. This question had previously been Q5 in 2018. The 2020 question clarified the definition of automatically and automated process, provided examples of automated processes, and incl uded a space for comments. Q6a Which state agencies participate in automatic or automated voter registration. This question had previously been Q5a in 2018. In 2020, this was changed to a multiselect question with additional answer options that better ali gn with state practices. Q7 Whether the state has online registration. This question had previously been Q6 in 2018. The 2020 question clarified the definition of online registration and added an answer option for states that could only process registration updates through online registration. Q7a Whether a registrant needed a state issued form of identification in order to register online. This question had previously been Q6a in 2018. The 2020 question clarified that any state issued identification, not just drivers licenses, would apply to this question. Q9 Whether a state has same day voter registration SDR. This question had previously been Q7 in 2018. The 2020 question included a clarification that an overlap between the availability between the mail balloting period and the close of voter registration should not be considered SDR. Q9a The type of SDR offered by the state. This question had previously been Q7 in 2018. The 2020 question was changed from a single select question to a multiselect question . 208  Survey Methodology and Procedures Significantly Revised from 2018 Description Q20 Deadlines for mail voters to return their ballots. This question had previously been Q11 in 2018. The 2020 question restructured the answer options to provide greater clarity, eliminated the answer option for mailed ballots postmarked after Election Day, and included a comments section. Q24 Types of in person early voting permitted in a state. This question had previously been Q12 in 2018. The 2020 question asked for what terminology a state used to describe inperson early voting and clarified that hand delivery of mail ed ballots by voters should not be considered early voting. Q24a Whether an excuse was required for early voting. This question had previously been Q12a in 2018. The 2020 question was updated to match the wording of Q24. Q25 Whether a state used vote centers. This question had previously been Q13 in 2018. The 2020 question clarified that polling locations that function as a vote center, even if the terminology is not the same, should be included in this qu estion. Q26 Which Federal Post Card Application FPCA submission methods are permitted in the state. This question had previously been Q14 in 2018. The 2020 question clarified that postal mail does not need to be specified, as this mode of submission is required in all states. Q27 Whether FPCA registration is permanent or temporary. This question had previously been Q15 in 2018. The 2020 question included updated wording to clarify that it applie s to how long an FPCA register s a person as a UOCAVA voter. Q28 How long a voter remains eligible to receive a UOCAVA ballot after registering with an FPCA. This question had previously been Q15 in 2018. The 2020 question provided more extensive answer options. Q29 Deadline for domestic military UOCAVA voters to return their ballots. This question had previously been Q17 in 2018. The 2020 question was revised to match the format of Q20, which collect s data on the deadline for voters to return mailed ballots, and the instructions were upda ted to specify that the question applie s to domestic military UOCAVA voters rather than all UOCAVA voters. Q32c How a state would handle a provisional ballot cast in the wrong precinct. This question had previously been Q18 in 2018. The 2020 question incl uded an instruction about the definition of a partially counted provisional ballot. Q34 Reasons for conducting post election recounts of ballots. This question had previously been Q19 in 2018. The 2020 question added a definition of election recount and included updated answer options. Q35 Statutory requirements for audits.

The 2020 question included revised question wo rding and was changed to a multiselect question. Survey Methodology and Procedures  209 Significantly Revised from 2018 Description Q37a How long people with disqualifying felony convictions lose their ability to vote. This question had previously been Q23 in 2018. The 2020 question was changed to a multiselect question, added an answer option for payment of outstanding fines, and the answer options were reworded to be mutually exclusive. Q37b How people with disqualifying felony convictions can have their voting rights restored. This question had previously been Q24 in 2018. The 2020 q uestion was changed to a multiselect question, the wording of the answer options was clarified, and a comment section was added. The foll owing questions had no change except for renumbering and, for some, the addition of a comment section 2020 Numbering 2018 Numbering Description Q3 Q1 How the state answers the EAVS . Q4 Q2 Whether the state has a top down, bottom up, or hybrid voter registration database . Q4a Q2a How often bottom up or hybrid databases transmit information to the state voter registration database . Q17 Q8 Whether an excuse is required for mail voting . Q18 Q9 Whether the state, or any jurisdiction within the state, conducted an all voteby mail election for the November 2020 general election . Q18a Q9a Whether the all votebymail system was used statewide or only in certain jurisdictions for the 2020 general e lection . Q19 Q10 Whether permanent mail voting is permitted . Q19a Q10a Which voters are permitted to register as permanent mail voters . Q25a Q13a How vote centers operate within the state . The 20 18 Policy Survey questions on audits of polling place procedures, audits of voting machines, and types of ballots audited were removed for 2020. Section A Voter Registration Section A of the EAVS collects data on voter registration. This includes the number of persons registered and eligible to vote in the November 2020 general election, active and inactive voters, voters who used SDR , registration forms processed between the close of registration for the 2018 general election and the close of registration for the 2020 general election, confirmation not ices sent pursuant to the NVRA, and voters removed from the voter registration rolls. 210  Survey Methodology and Procedures In 2020, changes to this section included the addition of sub questions on the number of SDRs received on Election Day A2b and before Election Day A2c, in addition to the total provided in A2a. The instructions in this question were also revised to clarify that all SDRs received for the 2020 general election should be reported. In addition, the instructions for A4 A7 were revised to clarify that online voter registrati ons reported in A4c, A5c, A6c, and A7c should only include registration forms that were completed and submitted through a web based online registration form system and that SDRs should be categorized according to the mode used to submit the registration ap plication. The instructions for A8 were revised to include a more accurate definition of the term confirmation notice and to clarify that notices sent between the close of registration for the November 2018 general election and the close of registration for the November 2020 general election should be reported in this question. Section B UOCAVA Section B of the EAVS collects data on voters covered by UOCAVA. This includes the number of registered UOCAVA voters FPCAs received and rejected UOCAVA ballots transmitted, returned, counted, and rejected and Federal Write In Absentee Ballots FWAB received, counted, and rejected. Most questions in Section B were divided by type of voter uniformed services members and overseas citizens  and by method of ballot transmission and return postal mail, email, and other. In 2014, the UOCAVA section of the EAVS was expanded to include questions from the Federal Voting Assistance Programs FVAP Post Election Quantitative Survey. The goal of combining surveys was to reduce the burden on election officials by asking them to answer a single set of questions about UOCAVA voting rather than answering two surveys that captured many of the same data points. The current format of Section B is the result of a memorand um of understanding between the EAC and FVAP that allows both agencies to collect, share, and evaluate data on the voting experiences of citizens covered under UOCAVA and to fulfill their congressionally mandated requirements to study UOCAVA voters. In 2020, changes to this section included the addition of question B27. Previously, the questions in the EAVS relating to FWABs only asked for data on FWABs rejected from being received after the ballot receipt deadline or because the voters regular absentee ballot was received and counted. The addition of B27 allows states to report data on FWABs rejected for other reasons, in total B27a, for uniformed services voters B27b, and for overseas citizen voters B27c. A space was also provided to collect a description of the reasons the FWABs reported in B27 were rejected. In addition, the instructions for question B8 were updated to clarify that ballots transmitted by other mode could include fax and online ballot delivery portals. Section C Mail Voting Section C of the EAVS collects data on mail voting. This includes the number of mail ed ballots transmitted, returned, counted, and rejected, as well as the number of ballots sent to permanent mail voters. Survey Methodology and Procedures  211 In 2020, changes to this section included a clarification to the instructions of C1 that all mail ed ballots transmitted for the November 2020 general election should be included in this question, and a clarification to the instructions of C2 that ballots transmitted in an all vote bymail state or jurisdiction should not be included in the count of mail ed ballots transmitted to permanent absentee voters. Section D In Person Voting and Polling Operations Section D of the EAVS collects data on in person voting. This includes the number of ballots cast throu gh in person voting before and on Election Day, the number of precincts and polling places, and the number of poll workers and the level of difficulty involved in recruiting poll workers. This section was previously called Total Votes Cast and In Person Voting and was renamed in 2020 to reflect the removal of a redundant question about the total votes cast and to better align with the sections focus on in person voting and the polling operations to support in person voting . The removal of the 2018 questi on on total votes cast caused the questions in Section D to be renumbered. The removed question on total votes cast was redundant with question F1a on the number of votes cast and counted. In addition, the instructions in questions D5 D7 were updated to clarify the definition of a poll worker and to specify how poll workers should be counted. The instructions for D6 were updated to specify that each early voting poll worker should be counted once regardless of how many early voting shifts they worked, and the instructions for D7 were updated to specify that each poll worker should be counted only once, regardless of how many shifts they worked. Section E Provisional Ballots Section E of the EAVS collects data on provisional voting, including provisional ballots submitted, provisional ballot adjudication, and reasons for rejection. In 2020, changes to this section included a clarification of the instructions in E1b d that the number of provisional ballots submitted should be recorded. A definition of provisional ballots counted in part was added to the instructions of E1c. Section F Voter Participation and Election Technologies Section F of the EAVS collects data on voter participation and election technologies. This includes total participation in the 2020 g eneral election, how many ballots were cast and counted by mode of participation, the source of participation data, use of electronic and paper poll books, voting equipment used, and the location where votes are tallied. Respondents were also provided the opportunity to share general comments regarding their states or jurisdictions Election Day experiences, noteworthy successes, and challenges they overcame when administering the November 2020 general election. In 2020, changes to this section included a clarification of how participation should be counted in question F1. The 2018 question collected data on the number of voters who participated this instruction was updated for 2020 to clarify that voters who cast a ballot that w as counted should be 212  Survey Methodology and Procedures reported in this question. In addition, question F1e removed the instruction that provisional voters who were given credit in their vote history should be included in this question. The instructions for question F8 were updated to include a more complete description of scanners. Data Collection Procedures In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the EAC submitted the questions for the 2020 Policy Survey and the EAVS for review by the Office of Management and Budget OMB and for public comment. Public comments were collected from October 8, 2019 , to December 6, 2019 , and from February 11, 2020 , to March 12, 2020. The questions were approved under OMB Control No. 3265 0006, expiration date March 31, 2023. The survey questio ns were made available publicly on the EACs website on July 8, 2020 . Targeted communications with state points of contact POC responsible for completing the surveys began on July 7, 2020 , and continued regularly throughout the data collection period. Th ese targeted communications aimed to keep states aware of data collection deadlines and resources available to assist them with completing the survey. The following sections describe each aspect of the EAVS data collection process in more detail. Needs Ass essment To better understand how state level officials respond to the EAVS and where they need support, the EAC undertook a systematic assessment of the needs of EAVS POCs in October and November 2019. The goal of these interviews was to better understand each states EAVS reporting process including how data is collected, which templates are used, the states use of technical assistance resources, and data quality and how improvements could be made to the 2020 EAVS. All state POCs that completed the 2018 EAVS were invited to participate and interviews with 34 states were completed. The EAC created semi structured interview guides for each participant that also left room for the moderator to probe further. The information collected through these needs asse ssment conversations helped the EACs outreach plan design , shaped the training opportunities provided to each state, and identified states that needed specialized support to complete the EAVS. Based on these conversations, the EAC made improvements to the design and usability of the data collection templates, added supplementary instructions to clarify how respondents were to use the missing data codes in the survey, and released the EAVS data collection templates earlier than in previous years to afford P OCs more time to compile their data submissions. During these needs assessment calls, the EAC also encouraged state POCs to review and provide comments on the draft 2020 survey questions, which at the time were available on the Federal Register. Policy Sur vey Invitations to complete the 2020 Policy Survey were sent to all 56 states, territories, and districts on August 3, 2020. The Policy Survey data are collected in advance of EAVS data collection to reduce respondent burden and to allow the EAC to create data validation rules for the EAVS data. The Policy Survey was completed through an online survey this survey had undergone usability testing with POCs from nine states and territories in June and July 2020, and edits to the survey based on the Survey Methodology and Procedures  213 results of this testing were completed in advance of the surveys launch.3 Periodic reminders were issued to POCs during the data collection period. All 56 states, territories, and districts submitted their Policy Survey data by December 15, 2020. When the answer options within a question did not fully capture a states policy, POCs were encouraged to provide comments with further explanation. The 2020 Policy Survey had a series of questions about the contact information of state and local election offices. The EAC collected this contact information from state election websites and official registers in May and June 2020. This information was pre populated into the online Policy Survey data collection tool and was provided to POCs to review and correct as they completed the Policy Survey. Because this data contains personally identifiable information PII, it is not part of the public data release. Once received, each Policy Survey submission was reviewed for completeness. Through these reviews and through further reviews conducted once each states EAVS submission was received, the EAC made Policy Survey corrections for 37 s tates before the end of the EAVS data collection period. For the first time, the EAC incorporated a states Policy Survey submission directly into the EAVS data collection template validations in 2020. This means that a states 2020 EAVS data collection templates could not be released until the states Policy Survey submission was finalized. EAVS The EAVS data collection period was opened to 46 states on November 9, 2020. The data collection was opened to the 10 remaining states once their Policy Survey submissions were received and their templates were finalized all data collection templates were released to states by December 18, 2020. The EAVS data collection period ended in July 2021. Data submissions from all 56 states were recei ved by that date, with a response rate of 100 of states. After providing final data, states chief election officials certified their Policy Survey and EAVS as complete and correct to the best of their knowledge. To build on the needs assessment conversat ions that were completed in October and November 2019, the EAC completed pre survey outreach calls with officials from states that had new designated POCs for the 2020 EAVS or that had requested further follow up after the needs assessment calls. Fifteen s tates were invited to participate in the outreach calls, and 10 states completed calls in August of 2020. During these interviews, the EAC provided an overview of the project timeline and the types of data collected in the Policy Survey and the EAVS, notif ied the POCs of the help desk support and other resources that would be provided as part of the 2020 EAVS, probed POCs on data issues from the 2018 EAVS, and whether the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic was impacting the states election policies or could affect its ability to submit EAVS data in a timely 3 Fiftythree states completed the Policy Survey via the online survey. Three states completed the survey via a paper instrument for these states, the Policy Survey technical assistants entered the data from the paper instrument into the online survey and asked the state to review for accuracy and submit the data. 214  Survey Methodology and Procedures manner. These conversations helped ensure that the EAC was prepared to provide adequate support to states as they completed their EAVS data collection. Data Collection Templates Given the diversity in how states respond to the EAVS, creating data templates that accommodate the needs of all states and all local jurisdictions is especially challenging. The 2020 EAVS data were collected using two data collection templates The Excel template was a flat data format that allowed POCs to copy and paste large amounts of data, such as from a report generated from the states centralized election database. Each EAVS item was listed in a column in the Excel template and each EAVS jurisdiction within thestate was listed in a row. States with multiple jurisdictions were required to submit their data through the Excel template. The online template was an item byitem survey hosted online that guided respondents through entering their responses. This template was primarily inten ded to be used by jurisdictions that entered EAVS data, although some states entered data into the onlinetemplate on behalf of some or all of their jurisdictions. The data from the online template wasexported to an Excel file that matched the format of the Excel data collection template. Usability testing of the draft online template was completed with nine local election officials between July and August 2020, and edits to the survey based on the results of this testing were completed in advance of the online templates launch. The EAC pre populated data into the online template for four states and into the Excel template for one state. Pre fill data was provided by state POC s via the Excel template or via an email or phone request that provided detail on which items were to be populated. Both data collection templates employed a variety of error checking data validations to reduce response burden and to increase data quality. Data Validation One of the key issues associated with any data collection projec t is ensuring that the data collected are as accurate as possible . Given the number of survey questions, their complexity and granularity, and the variety of approaches in how state and local jurisdictions provide responses, it can be easy to make data entry mistakes or report data in an incorrect survey item. All 2020 EAVS data collection templates included built in internal and external validation checks that flagged specific types of potential errors within a data submission . The validation checks were d esigned to flag common data issues so that respondents were aware of them before submitting their data to the EAC. In response to these validations, states and jurisdictions were encouraged to review their data, correct it if needed, and use the comments f ields to explain any peculiarities and give context to the data that were being reported. Survey Methodology and Procedures  215 In addition, once a state submitted data for review by the EAC, additional data reviews were conducted by trained data analysts. These reviews checked for missing dat a, internal math and logic issues, conflicts with Policy Survey responses, and significant changes compared to 2016 EAVS data. 4 The results of this review were provided to state POCs in a written memo, along with a file that had sample rates and percentages calculated using their draft submission. These sample rates and percentages were provided to assist POCs with identifying results that did not align with their expectations , so they could be corrected in the final submission. A complete list of all vali dation checks that were built into the data collection templates and additional data validations that were conducted for draft submissions can be found in A ppendices B and C of this chapter. In general, there were five types of data validations. Math Valid ations Many items in the EAVS asked respondents to report a total and then divide that total into subcategories. The math validations within the templates checked that the sum of the subcategories equaled the reported total of the overall category. For exa mple, if the total number of voters who cast a ballot that was counted in the 2020 general election did not match the sum of the number of voters who used different modes of voting, then the respondent was asked to review the numbers reported in these item s. 5 Logic Validations Logic validations identified when a value in the survey was incompatible with a response provided in another related question in the survey. For example, if the number of mail ed ballots counted by a jurisdiction exceeded the number of mailed ballots that had been returned by voters, then the respondent was asked to review these items. 6 Policy Survey Validations These validations identified instances in which an EAVS item conflic ted with the Policy Survey data that had been submitted by the state. For example, if a state reported having an online voter registration system through which an individual could submit a voter registration application, but reported does not apply to EAVS items relating to the number of voter registration forms submitted through online sources, then the validations would highlight that a conflict existed between the respondents EAVS and Policy Survey data and would ask the respondent to review the EAVS items and contact the EAC if the Policy Survey response needed to be updated. 7 4 The 2016 EAVS was used as a point of comparison in the data reviews , because it was the most recent presidential election. 5 The total number of voters participating in the 2020 general election was reported in item F1a in the 2020 EAVS. The number of voters who participated using different modes of voting were items F1b through F1h. 6 The number of mailed ballot s counted by a jurisdiction was reported in item C3a in the 2020 EAVS. The number of mailed ballot s returned by voters was reported in item C1b. 7 Data on states policies regarding online voter registration were reported in item Q7 in the Policy Survey. The number of total, new, duplicate, and rejected registrations received through online registration systems were reported in items A4c, A5c, A6c, and A7c, respectively, of EAVS. 216  Survey Methodology and Procedures Missing Items With the exception of comment boxes and other subcategories for reporting data beyond what was specified in a question, all items in the EAVS required a respons e. An alert appeared if a response to a required item was not provided. For example, if a respondent reported the total number of registered voters in their jurisdiction but not the number of active and inactive registered voters, the latter items would be flagged with a request that the respondent should report does not apply if their state does not have an applicable law or policy, data not available if the data for an item is not tracked , or zero if no instance of an item occurred rather than leave the item blank. 8 Valid Skips For the first time, in 2020, the EAC introduced a valid skip code to the EAVS data. This code was automatically filled in by the template validations when an item did not require an answer because of a response to a previ ous item in the survey. The use of the valid skip code is distinct from the use of the does not apply code for when a jurisdiction does not have a law or policy in place that allows for the type of election participation in the question and the data not available code for when the data for a type of election participation is not tracked. For instance, if a jurisdiction indicated in EAVS question F5a that it did not use direct recording electronic DRE voting machines without a voter verified paper audit trail VVPAT , then items F5b through F5d, relating to the make and model of equipment, the number deployed, and the usage of the equipment, were filled as valid skip by the template validations. Technical Assistance Technical assistance was provid ed through the duration of the Policy Survey and the EAVS data collection periods. Help desk support was provided for 20 hours each week from August 3, 2020 , to December 31, 2020, and for 50 hours each week from January 4, 2021 , to March 30, 2021. State and local EAVS respondents could request assistance via email or phone. A team of trained technical assistants provided support on all aspects of the survey data collection processes. A total of 812 support tickets were received from all 56 states, territori es, and districts. The most common inquiries were related to accessing the data collection templates, re opening online templates that had been submitted prematurely, how data transferred between the online template and the Excel template, and questions ab out survey definitions including SDR, how to classify registration forms in questions A3 A7, and what types of voting should be counted as in person early voting for purposes of EAVS. After the first round of EAVS data was collected in March 2021, a group of subject matter experts SME from the EAC conducted an extra quality control review via video conference . All states and territories were invited to participate and 51 out of 56 participated. The extra quality check was necessary due to the new voting options throughout the country for the 2020 general election and due to challenges caused by the COVID 19 pand emic. Thirty eight of the states and territories that were interviewed requested data changes or addedamended footnotes to this report. 8 The total number of registered voters for the 2020 general election was reported in item A1a in the EAVS. The number of active registered voters was item A1b. Th e number of inactive registered voters was item A1c. Survey Methodology and Procedures  217 Resources for EAVS Respondents In addition to providing direct, customized technical assistance, the EAC made a wide va riety of written and video training resources available to survey respondents on demand. A website was established to house these resources and to provide a secure place for state EAVS POCs to upload data submissions and other documents for the EAC to revi ew. The resources on this website included PDF copies of the Policy Survey and EAVS questions a link to the online template six videos that outlined the questions and instructions in the six sections of the EAVS three video webinars that provided guidan ce on the overall EAVS process, on collecting data from local jurisdictions, and for state POCs new to EAVS data collection eleven newsletters that were released between August 2020 and March 2021 an extensive user guide that provided step bystep instru ctions for both data collection templates a policy guide approved by the EAC Commissioners that provide d information to election officials responsible for completing EAVS  and an Excel crosswalk that documented survey changes from 2018 to 2020. The website also contained a section that was restricted to state POCs. This section had copies of the states 2016 and 2018 EAVS and the states Statutory Overview or Policy Survey data available for download, a table that tracked the online template progress for each jurisdiction within the state, and the capacity for POCs to upload files for the EAC to review. Data Reporting and Calculations In 2020, most EAVS data were reported at the local jurisdiction level. For the purposes of this report, for states that have multiple jurisdictions, state totals were calculated by summing the data from all jurisdictions within a state. National totals were calculated by summing the state level totals. Whenever possible, this report uses percentages and rates rather than raw nu mb ers to make comparisons across states and across election years. For these calculations, items were combined as necessary to create the numerator and denominator and to produce a percentage or rate. For example, the following formula was used to calculat e the percentage of transmitted mail ed ballots that were returned by voters for the 2020 general election          1 100          1 Percentages at the national level were calculated using casewise missing data deletion at the state level. Only states that had data for both the numerator and denominator for a calculation were included when reporting percentages at the national level. Re sponses of does not apply, data not available, and valid skip were considered missing for purposes of creating these calculations. Casewise deletion was used in the analysis for this report to avoid overinflating the denominator of the calculations. This is especially applicable when states do not track data for a particular item, or when election policy differences mean that not all states can provide data for an item. For example, online registration is not available in every state, so the calculati on of the nationwide percentage of registrations that were received online will only use data from states that reported at least one online 218  Survey Methodology and Procedures registration. Otherwise, the national percentage would include in the denominator in this case, the total number of registrations received data from states that do not have online registration, thus underestimating the percentage of online registrations that were received.9 This decision rule means that there were instances in which the percentages reported at the na tional level for a given calculation in this report did not use data from every state. Because each category was calculated independently of others and only states that reported data in both the numerator and the denominator were included in the analysis, casewise deletion also created instances in which percentages do not sum to 100. Those cases in which data were not available for every state to calculate the percentage at the national level are noted in the footnotes throughout this report. Recommendations for Analyzing and Interpreting the EAVS Data The most up todate version of the 2020 EAVS and Policy Survey data can always be found on the EACs website httpswww.eac.govresearch anddatadatasets codebooks andsurveys . If the EAC is notified by a state of an error or omission in the states data, the agency will issue the updated EAVS and Policy Survey data sets on its website with an errata note of changes that have been made to the newly issued data sets. Updated data sets will be issued on a quarterly basis. There are four types of data missingness codes used in the 2020 Policy Survey and EAVS data Valid skip  77 This code indicates that no response is expected based on a previous survey response. For instance, in the Policy Survey, if a state answered no to Q7 to indicate that it does not provide an option for voters to register to vote online, then items Q7a and Q7b, which collect further information on the specifics of a states online registration system, would be marked as  77. In the EAVS, if a state indicates in item A4c, the total number of registration forms submitted onl ine, that this question does not apply, then items A5c, A6c, and A7c, which collect data on new, duplicate, and rejected registrations submitted online, would be marked as 77. Does not apply  88 This code indicates that a question does not apply to a s tate, because the state does not have an applicable policy in place. For instance, a response of  88 in item A4c of the EAVS indicates that the state does not have online registration. Data not available  99 This code indicates that the data for an item cannot be tracked. For instance, a response of  99 in item A4c of the EAVS indicates that the state accep ts online voter registrations but cannot track the number of these registrations that were submitted byvoters. Refused  100 This code indicates th at a response was expected but was not provided. This code is only used in the Policy Survey data. 9 The total number of registration applications received between the close of registration for the 2018 general election and the close of registration for the 2020 general election was collected in item A3a. The total number of registration applications received online between the close of registration for the 2018 general election and the close of registration for the 2020 general election was collected in item A4c. The application of casewise deletion m eans that only states that reported at least one registration in both of these items on a statewide level were included in the calculation of the percentage of registration applications received through online sources. Survey Methodology and Procedures  219 When summing the EAVS data, either on a state or a national level, analysts should take care to treat these missingness codes as missing items and not as negative numbers . Users of the EAVS data are also encouraged to refer to the comments that accompany all of the EAVS items and many of the Policy Survey items. During data collection, the EAC encouraged all respondents to use these comments to provide context to their responses. In many cases, these comments contain valuable information about how state and jurisdiction respondents formulated their responses, why some responses do not align with the data validations outlined in this chapter, or context about how the 2020 general election was conducted in a state or jurisdiction. If data users have further questions about the data that have been submitted, they are encouraged to contact states or jurisdictions directly with further questions. The EAC also encoura ges data users to take care when calculating percentages to ensure that the correct EAVS items are used. Appendix D of this chapter contains recommendations for how to calculate EAVS rates using the 2020 data . These recommendations align with how rates were calculated throughout this report. This report used the 1 year American Community Survey ACS state estimate s for the 2019 citizen voting age population CVAP instead of the 5 year estimate to ensure that the CVAP wa s as current as possible. The CVAP estimates for 2020 were not available by the time this report was finalized . Once they are released by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2020 CVAP estimates can be found at httpsdata.census.gov . Data analysts should import both the state and county level geographies and merge them into the EAVS data using the Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS  code. For states that have subcounty jurisdictions, these jurisdictions will need to be aggregated at the county level in order to merge in the CVAP data.10 For this report, the state level CVAP was used for Alaska and Puerto Rico, as both reported as a single EAVS jurisdictio n. Finally, the Census Bureau does not provide CVAP estimates for the U.S. territories with the exception of Puerto Rico, so no CVAP estimate was available for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S . Virgin Islands. 10 These are the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Additionally, the state of Illinois report ed six cities independently of their corresponding counties  i.e., Bloomington, Chicago, Danville, East St. Louis, Galesburg, and Rockford, and Missouri report ed Kansas City independently of its corresponding county. 220  Survey Methodology and Procedures Methodology Appendix A Survey Response Rates State EAVS Response Rate Section A Response Rate Section B Response Rate Section C Response Rate Section D Response Rate Section E Response Rate Section F Response Rate Alabama 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Alaska 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 American Samoa 98.4 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 94.4 Arizona 100.0 100.0 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Arkansas 90.2 99.5 77.4 83.5 88.1 82.5 97.3 California 99.2 100.0 98.2 99.9 99.8 99.9 98.9 Colorado 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Connecticut 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Delaware 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 District of Columbia 99.7 100.0 100.0 100.0 94.7 100.0 100.0 Florida 99.4 100.0 98.7 99.9 99.2 96.4 99.8 Georgia 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Guam 98.1 93.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 98.9 Hawaii 1 99.1 100.0 99.5 100.0 100.0 100.0 97.1 Idaho 99.4 98.8 99.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Illinois 99.1 99.6 99.7 99.8 99.7 98.6 97.9 Indiana 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.9 100.0 100.0 Iowa 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.9 Kansas 69.0 67.4 86.8 77.3 62.3 95.9 48.0 Kentucky 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Louisiana 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Maine 2 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Maryland 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Massachusetts 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Michigan 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Minnesota 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.9 100.0 100.0 Mississippi 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.9 Missouri 99.8 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.4 Montana 99.6 100.0 98.5 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Nebraska 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Nevada 99.8 100.0 99.2 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 New Hampshire 99.5 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 98.3 New Jersey 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 New Mexico 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.7 100.0 100.0 New York 97.5 100.0 100.0 99.9 99.7 100.0 91.1 North Carolina 99.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.7 Survey Methodology and Procedures  221 State EAVS Response Rate Section A Response Rate Section B Response Rate Section C Response Rate Section D Response Rate Section E Response Rate Section F Response Rate North Dakota 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Northern Mariana Islands 96.2 100.0 90.0 100.0 94.7 100.0 96.7 Ohio 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Oklahoma 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Oregon 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Pennsylvania 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.9 Puerto Rico 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Rhode Island 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 South Carolina 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 South Dakota 99.9 100.0 99.8 99.9 98.8 99.8 100.0 Tennessee 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Texas 99.4 100.0 99.6 100.0 100.0 100.0 98.2 U.S. Virgin Islands 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Utah 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.8 Vermont 98.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 93.0 Virginia 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Washington 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 West Virginia 99.7 100.0 98.8 100.0 99.9 100.0 100.0 Wisconsin 99.7 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 98.9 Wyoming 99.9 100.0 99.6 100.0 99.8 100.0 100.0 U.S. Total 99.1 99.4 99.4 99.4 99.2 99.7 98.2 Survey Response Rate Calculation Notes  EAVS Response Rate uses responses to all items listed below.
